(Ooh)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)\nThat's my prerogative\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey say I'm crazy, I really don't care\nThat's my prerogative\nThey say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn\nGettin' girls is how I live\nSome ask me questions, why am I so real?\nBut they don't understand me\nOr really don't know the deal about a brother\nTryin' hard to make it right\nNot long ago, before I win this fight (Sing)\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's talkin' all this stuff about me\nWhy don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)\nThat's my prerogative\n\n[Refrain]\nIt's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)\nI can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)\nNo one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)\n'Cause what I'm doing, I'm doing for you, now\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't get me wrong, I'm really not souped\nEgo trips is not my thing\nAll these strange relationships really gets me down\nI see nothing wrong spreadin' myself around (Sing)\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's talkin' all this stuff about me (Yeah)\nWhy don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\nThat's my prerogative\n\n[Refrain]\nIt's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)\nI can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)\nCan live my life (It's my prerogative)\nI'm doing it just for you (It's my prerogative)\n[Bridge]\nTell me, tell me, why can't I live my life (Live my life)\nWithout all of the things that people say?\n\n[Interlude]\nYo Teddy, kick it like this\nOh, no, no\nI can do what I wanna do\nMe and you\nTogether, together, together, together, together\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's talkin' all this stuff about me (Everybody's talkin')\nWhy don't they just let me live?\n(Why don't they just let me live, girl?)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\n(I don't need permission from nobody)\nThat's my prerogative\n\nEverybody's talkin' all this stuff about me (Everybody's talkin')\nWhy don't they just let me live? (Now)\nI don't need permission, make my own decisions\nThat's my prerogative\n\n[Outro]\nWhat is this, a blizzard, that I can't have money in my pocket\nAnd people not talk about me?\nThis world is a trip; I don't know what's goin' on these days\nGot this person over here talkin' about me, this person\nAy, listen, let me tell you somethin', it's my prerogative\nI can do what I wanna do\nI made this money, you didn't; right, Ted?\nWe outta here!\nIt's my, it's my, it's my, it's my\nIt's my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my\nIt's my...Woo!\nIt's my prerogative, it's my...\nIt's my, it's my, my, my\nIt's my prerogative, can't you see, baby doll?\nHa, why you wanna talk about me?\nTell me, tell me why...6Embed"
