I’ll leave on the lights\nBaby, you can crash my party anytime\n[Verse 2]\nAin’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me\nAin’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do\nI could be on the front row of the best show\nAnd look down and see your face on my phone\nAnd I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanna call me, call me, call me\nYou don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby\nYou can wake me up in the dead of the night\nWreck my plans, baby that’s alright\nThis is a drop everything kind of thing\nSwing on by I will pour you a drink\nThe door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights\nBaby, you can crash my party anytime\n\n[Bridge]\nIf it’s two in the morning and you’re feeling lonely\nAnd wondering what I’m doing\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanna call me, call me, call me\nYou don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby\nYou can wake me up in the dead of the night\nWreck my plans, baby that’s alright\nThis is a drop everything kind of thing\nSwing on by I will pour you a drink\nThe door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights\nBaby, you can crash my party anytime\nBaby, you can crash my party anytime12Embed"
