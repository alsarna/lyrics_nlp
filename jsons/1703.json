Me workin' for you!\"\nWhoa-oh-oh\n\n[Chorus]\nSign, sign, everywhere a sign\nBlockin' out the scenery\nBreakin' my mind\nDo this, don't do that\nCan't you read the sign?\n[Verse 2]\nAnd the sign said anybody caught trespassing\nWould be shot on sight\nSo I jumped on the fence and I yelled at the house\n\"Hey! What gives you the right?\nTo put up a fence to keep me out\nOr to keep Mother Nature in\nIf God was here he'd tell you to your face\nMan, you're some kinda sinner\"\n\n[Chorus]\nSign, sign, everywhere a sign\nBlockin' out the scenery\nBreakin' my mind\nDo this, don't do that\nCan't you read the sign?\n\n{In album version only}\n\n[Bridge]\nNow, hey you, mister, can't you read?\nYou've got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat\nYou can't even watch, no, you can't eat\nYou ain't supposed to be here\nThe sign said you got to have a membership card to get inside\nUgh!\n[Verse 3]\nAnd the sign said, \"Everybody welcome. Come in, kneel down and pray\"\nBut when they passed around the plate at the end of it all, I didn't have a penny to pay\nSo I got me a pen and a paper and I made up my own little sign\nI said, \"Thank you, Lord, for thinkin' 'bout me. I'm alive and doin' fine.\"\nWooo!\n\n[Chorus]\nSign, sign, everywhere a sign\nBlockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind\nDo this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?\n\n{Outro}\nSign, sign, everywhere a sign\nSign\nSign, sign3Embed"
