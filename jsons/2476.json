(Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nWould you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nIf I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)\nCould you feel the same way too, I wanna know\nThe name of the game\n[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]\nI have no friends, no one to see\nAnd I am never invited\nNow I am here, talking to you\nNo wonder I get excited\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]\nYour smile, and the sound of your voice\nAnd the way you see through me\nGot a feeling, you give me no choice\nBut it means a lot to me\nSo I wanna know\n\n[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida & Björn]\nWhat's the name of the game?\n(Your smile and the sound of your voice)\nDoes it mean anything to you?\n(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)\nWhat's the name of the game?\n(Your smile and the sound of your voice)\nCan you feel it the way I do?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Frida]\nTell me, please, 'cause I have to know\nI'm a bashful child beginning to grow\n[Bridge: Frida, Agnetha & Frida]\nAnd you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nAnd you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nAnd you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nWhat I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nIf I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nWould you let me down? (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nWould you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)\nIf I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)\nCould you feel the same way too, I wanna know\nOh, yes, I wanna know\n\n[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida & Björn]\nThe name of the game\n(I was an impossible case)\nDoes it mean anything to you?\n(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)\nWhat's the name of the game?\n(Your smile and the sound of your voice)\nCan you feel it the way I do?\n(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)\n\n[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida & Björn]\nThe name of the game\n(I was an impossible case)\nDoes it mean anything to you?\n(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)\nWhat's the name of the game?\n(Your smile and the sound of your voice)\nCan you feel it..."
