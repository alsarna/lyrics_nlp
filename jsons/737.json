    "lyrics": "The Way You Look Tonight LyricsSome day, when I'm awfully low\nWhen the world is cold\nI will feel a glow just thinking of you...\nAnd the way you look tonight\n\nYes you're lovely, with your smile so warm\nAnd your cheeks so soft\nThere is nothing for me but to love you\nAnd the way you look tonight\n\nWith each word your tenderness grows\nTearing my fear apart...\n\nAnd that laugh that wrinkles your nose\nIt touches my foolish heart\nLovely ... Never, ever change\nKeep that breathless charm\nWon't you please arrange it ?\n'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight\n\nMm, Mm, Mm, Mm\nJust the way you look to-nightEmbed"
