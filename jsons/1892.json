    "lyrics": "She was black as the night;\nLouie was whiter than white\nDanger, danger when you taste brown sugar\nLouie fell in love overnight\n\nNothing bad, it was good\nLouie had the best girl he could\nWhen he took her home\nTo meet his mama and papa;\nLouie knew just where he stood\n\nLouie Louie Louie louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I\nLouie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry\n\nThere he stood in the night\nKnowing what's wrong from what's right\nHe took her home to meet his mama and papa\nMan, they had a terrible fight\n\nLouie nearly caused a scene\nWishin' it was a dream\nAin't no diff'rence if you're black or white\nBrothers, you know what I mean, come on\nLouie Louie Louie\n\nLouie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I\nLouie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry\n{Instrumental}\n\nLouie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I\nLouie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry"
