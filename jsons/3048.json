    "lyrics": "There was this new feeling coming out of the streets\nEverybody's talkin' 'bout it wherever they meet\nDown by the corner, keep getting the heat\nThen my feet start moving to the rhythmic beat\n\n[Chorus]\nBreakdancin'\nBreak out\nBreakdancin'\nBreak out\n\nThey used to do The Locomotion, do The Jerk and The Twist\nBut there just ain't never been nothin' like this\nNow poppin' and lockin' is the new way of talkin'\nThere's a work at the shop, spinnin' out on the floor\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHearts are pumpin', beat is thumpin'\nLove the way you're lookin' tonight\nFevers risin' no surprisin'\nWe won't have the time to fight\n(Dance, dance, dance, dance, out, out, out, out)\n\n[Chorus]"
