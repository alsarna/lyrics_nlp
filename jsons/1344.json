    "lyrics": "One day you're up and the next day you're down\nYou can't face the world with your head to the ground\nThe grass is always greener on the other side, they say\nSo don't worry, boys, life will be sweet some day\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nWe made enough mistakes\nBut you know we got what it takes\nOh, we ain't got nothin' yet\nNo, we ain't got nothin' yet\n\nNothin' can hold us and nothin' can keep us down\nAnd someday our names will be spread all over town\nWe can get in while the getting is good\nSo make it on your own, yeah, you know that you could\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nWe got to make the break\n'Cause we got too much at stake\nOh, we ain't got nothin' yet\nNo, we ain't got nothin' yet\n\nWe made enough mistakes\nBut you know we got what it takes\nOh, we ain't got nothin' yet\nNo, we ain't got nothin' yet"
