Kelly]\nAnd then you will see, the morning will come\nAnd every day will be bright as the sun\nAll of your fears, cast them on me\nI just want you to see\n\n[Chorus: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]\nI'll be your cloud up in the sky\nI'll be your shoulder when you cry\nI'll hear your voices when you call me\nI am your angel\nAnd when all hope is gone, I'm here\nNo matter how far you are, I'm near\nIt makes no difference who you are\nI am your angel\nI'm your angel\n\n[Verse 2: R. Kelly]\nI saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry\nAll you need is time, seek me and you shall find\nYou have everything and you're still lonely\nIt don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day\n[Pre-Chorus: Céline Dion]\nAnd then you will see, the morning will come\nAnd all of your days will be bright as the sun\nSo all of your fears, just cast them on me\nHow can I make you see?\n\n[Chorus: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]\nI'll be your cloud up in the sky\nI'll be your shoulder when you cry\nI'll hear your voices when you call me\nI am your angel\nAnd when all hope is gone, I'm here\nNo matter how far you are, I'm near\nIt makes no difference who you are\nI am your angel\nI'm your angel\n\n[Verse 3: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]\nAnd when it's time to face the storm\nI'll be right by your side\nGrace will keep us safe and warm\nAnd I know we will survive\nAnd when it seems as if your end is drawing near\n(It is drawing near)\nDon't you dare give up the fight (Oh no)\nJust put your trust beyond the skies\n[Chorus: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]\nI'll be your cloud up in the sky\nI'll be your shoulder when you cry\nI'll hear your voices when you call me\nI am your angel\nAnd when all hope is gone, I'm here\nNo matter how far you are, I'm near\nIt makes no difference who you are\nI am your angel\nI'll be your cloud up in the sky\nI'll be your shoulder when you cry\nI'll hear your voices when you call me\nI am your angel\nAnd when all hope is gone, I'm here\nNo matter how far you are, I'm near\nIt makes no difference who you are\nI am your angel\nI'll be your cloud up in the sky\nI'll be your shoulder when you cry\nI'll hear your voices when you call me\nOh...oh...oh-oh...I'm your angel"
