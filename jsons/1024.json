    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nSince you left me and you said goodbye\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nAll I do is sit and cry\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nYou went away and left me misery\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nAnd that's the way it'll always be\n\n[Verse 2]\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nYou said you loved me and you'd always be mine\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nWe'd be together 'til the end of time\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nNow, you say it was just a game\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nBut all you're doin' is leavin' me pain\n\n[Bridge]\nTime goes by and goes so slow (Oh, yeah)\nIt just doesn't seem true\nOnly just a few days ago\nYou said you'd love me, never make me blue\n[Verse 3]\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nNow, you've gone and I'm all alone\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nAnd you're still way up there on your throne\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\nNothin' seems to ever go right\n(I'm in pieces, bits and pieces)\n'Cause night is day, and day is night"
