LyricsWe've already said goodbye\nSince you've got to go\nOh you'd better go now\nGo now, Go now\nGo now\nBefore you see me cry\nI don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now\n'Cause how many times do I have to tell you, darling, darling\nI'm still in love with you now?\n\nWe've already said so long\nI don't want to see you go\nOh you'd better go now\nGo now, Go now\nGo now\nDon't you even try...\nTelling me that you really don't want me to end this way\n'Cause darling, darling\nCan't you see I want you to stay?\nSince you've got to go\nOh you'd better go now\nGo now, Go now\nGo now\nBefore you see me cry\nI don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now\n'Cause how many times do I have to tell you, darling, darling\nI'm still in love, still in love with you now?\n\nI don't want to see you go\nBut, darling, you'd better go nowEmbed"
