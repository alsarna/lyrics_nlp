    "lyrics": "Lonely Blue Boy LyricsMy name should be trouble\nMy name should be woe\nFor trouble and heartache is all that I know\nYeah, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my name\n\nMy life has been empty\nMy heart has been torn\nIt must have been raining the night I was born\nYeah, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my name\n\nWell, I'm so\nI'm so afraid of tomorrow\nAnd so tired, so tired of today\nThey say that love is the answer\nBut love never came my way\nI'm writing this letter to someone unknown\nSo if you should find it and if you're alone\nWell, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my name\nRemember, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my nameEmbed"
