I bet you taught the other kids how\nWell, I can see the judge's eyes\nAs they handed you the prize\nI bet you took the cutest bow!\n\nYeah! You must a been a beautiful baby\n'cause baby won't you look at you now\n\nOh yeah ... oh yeah ... oh yeah ...\n\nYou must a have been a beautiful baby\nYou must a have been a beautiful child\nWhen you were only startin'\n\nTo go to kindergarten\nI know you drove the other childs wild\nAn' I wasn't even there\nAn' when you came to winnin' blue ribbons\nHey … I know you taught those other kids how\nWell, I can see the judge's eyes\nAs they handed you the prize\nI know you made the cutest bow!\n\nYeah! You must a been a beautiful baby\n‘cause baby won't you look at you now\nOh, I mean … I mean … oh, beautiful …\nOh, beautiful ...\nOh, beautiful ...\n\nOh, beautiful ...\nOh, beautiful ...\nOh, beautiful ...\n\nAah, I know you're beautiful … too beautiful for words ..."
