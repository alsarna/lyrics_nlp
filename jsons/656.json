    "lyrics": "I took a little trip to my home town\nI only stopped just to look around\nAnd as I walked along the thorough-fare\nThere was music playing everywhere\n\nThe music came from within my heart\nHow did it happen how did it start\nI only know that I fell in love\nI guess the answer lies up above\n\nOh what a feeling\nMy heart was reeling\nThe bells were ringing\nThe birds were singing\n\nAnd so the music keep goes on and on\nAnd through the night until the break of dawn\nI hear a bird up in the tree\nI hear him sing this melody\n\nAnd so he sings\nYa-ya-ya-ya...\n\nOh what a feeling\nMy heart was reeling\nThe bells were ringing\nThe birds were singing\nAnd so the music keep goes on and on\nAnd through the night until the break of dawn\nAnd every evening when the sun goes down\nI'm with my love in my home town\n\nAnd so I sing\nYa-ya-ya-ya..."
