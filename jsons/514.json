    "lyrics": "Guitar Boogie Shuffle LyricsDon't change yourself to suit everybody else\nDon't change yourself to suit everybody else\nYou lay staring at your ceiling through all of the night\nAnd out to haunt you come the ghosts of your life\nYou bury your head in a bone colored cradle\nBut do you sleep with a smile upon your face?\nThey say into every life a little rain must fall\nBut your dream cloud has burst\nAnd dripped all over your face\nA sick body forms a sick mind\nBut you're duty bound to do what's right\nIs that the oasis of light in the darkness of your life?\nYou can't admit, but you can't deny\nA small heart, a spiteful mind\nAre you good or bad you ask yourself\nAnd do the things you do hurt the ones who care the most for you\nAre you good or bad you ask yourself\nAnd do the things you do hurt the ones who care the most for you\nDon't change yourself to suit everybody else\nDon't change yourself to suit everybody else...Embed"
