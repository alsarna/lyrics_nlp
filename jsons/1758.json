    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI came upon a child of God\nHe was walking along the road\nWhen I asked him, where are you going?\nThis, he told me:\n\"I'm going down to Yasgur's farm\nThink I'll join a rock and roll band\nI'll camp out on the land\nI'll try and set my soul free\"\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust\nWe are golden\nAnd we've got to get ourselves back to the garden\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen, can I walk beside you?\nI have come here to lose the smog\nAnd I feel just like a cog\nIn something turning\nWell, maybe it's the time of year\nOr maybe it's the time of man\nAnd I don't know who I am\nBut life's for learning\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust\nWe are golden\nAnd we've got to get ourselves back to the garden\n[Verse 3]\nBy the time I got to Woodstock\nThey were half a million strong\nEverywhere there were songs and celebration\nAnd I dreamed I saw the bombers\nRiding shotgun in the sky\nTurning into butterflies\nAbove our nation\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust\nWe are golden\nAnd we've got to get ourselves back to the garden\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust\nWe are golden\nAnd we've got to get ourselves back to the garden\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust\nWe are golden\nAnd we've got to get ourselves back to the garden"
