    "lyrics": "Ooh, it must be magic\nHow inside your eyes I see my destiny\nEvery time we kiss\nI feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me\nIf the moon and stars should fall\nThey'd be easy to replace\nI would lift you up to heaven\nAnd you would take their place\n\nThen I saw red\nWhen I opened up the door\nI saw red\nMy heart just spilled onto the floor\nAnd I didn't need to see his face\nI saw yours\nI saw red and then I closed the door\nI don't think I'm gonna love you anymore\n\nEvery day I wake up\nI thank God that you are still a part of me\nWe've opened up the door to which\nSo many people never find the key\nAnd if the sun should ever fail to send its light\nWe would burn a thousand candles\nAnd make everything all right\nThen I saw red\nWhen I opened up the door\nI saw red\nMy heart just spilled onto the floor\nAnd I didn't need to see his face\nI saw yours\nI saw red and then I closed the door\nI don't think I'm gonna love you anymore\n\nI've been hurt and I've been blind\nI'm not sure that I'll be fine\nI never thought it would end this way\n\n'Cause I saw red\nWhen I opened up the door\nI saw red\nMy heart just spilled onto the floor\nAnd I didn't need to see his face\nOh, I saw yours\nI saw red and then I closed the door\nI don't think I'm gonna love you anymore\n\nOoh, it must be magic"
