I pull up in a 9/11\nI ain't made a wack song yet\nTold my youngers to put me a chain, stacks on deck\nIm A'Jd out, used to wear denim clothes\nNiggas thought ill never blow when I started selling draws\nWrapping out all night im soo knackered\nMe and lil T, united like Old Trafford\nWith my delivery, if I was in this industry id clearly sell\nBut im caught up in this scary world, ain't no fairy tale"
