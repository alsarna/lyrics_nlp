    "lyrics": "The Race Is On LyricsI feel tears well in up from deep inside\nLike my heart's goin' to break\nAnd a stab of loneliness sharp and painful\nThat I may never shake\nYou might say that I was takin' it hard\nSince you gave me the final goodbye\nBut don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow\nWhen I may break right down and cry\n\nNow the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch\nHeartaches are goin' to the inside\nMy tears are holdin' back\nThey're tryin' not to fall\nMy heart's out of the runnin'\nTrue love's scratched for another's sake\nThe race is on and it looks like heartaches\nAnd the winner loses all\nOne day I ventured in love, never once suspectin'\nWhat the final results would be\nHow I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'\nAnd find that you're gone from me\nThere's ache and pain in my heart\nFor the name of the one that I'll never replaced\nSomebody new came up to win her\nAnd I came out in second place\n\nNow the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch\nHeartaches are goin' to the inside\nMy tears are holdin' back\nThey're tryin' not to fall\nMy heart's out of the runnin'\nTrue love's scratched for another's sake\nThe race is on and it looks like heartaches\nAnd the winner loses allEmbed"
