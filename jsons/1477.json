    "lyrics": "Bend Me Shape Me LyricsYou are all the woman I need, and baby you know it\nYou can make this beggar a king, a clown or a poet\nI'll give you all that I own\nYou got me standing in line\nOut in the cold\nPay me some mind\n\nBend me, shape me\nAny way you want me\nLong as you love me, it's all right\nBend me, shape me\nAny way you want me\nYou got the power to turn on the light\n\nEverybody tells me I'm wrong to want you so badly\nBut there's a force driving me on, I follow it gladly\nSo let them laugh I don't care\nCause I got nothing to hide\nAll that I want is you by my side\nBend me, shape me\nAny way you want me\nLong as you love me, it's all right\nBend me, shape me\nAny way you want me\nYou got the power to turn on the light\nBend me shape me anyway you want me (fade)1Embed"
