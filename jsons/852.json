    "lyrics": "Why did I listen to my friends\nWhen they told me what to do\nYes, I still have my friends\nBut I don't have you\nAnd like true friends, they still come around\nAnd say, \"I'm sorry you're blue\"\nOh, everybody loves me but you\n\nMy friends don't know what they've done\nWwell, they wouldn't understand anyhow\nI can't tell them they were wrong\n'Cause I'm afraid they'll leave me, too\nNow it's funny but more than ever\nI need them now\n\nI still ask my friends what to do\nBut it seems they don't know\nHow to bring\nHow to bring you back\nThey say, \"what made him go?\"\nYes, like true friends, they still come around\nAnd say, \"I'm sorry you're blue\"\nOh, everybody loves me but you"
