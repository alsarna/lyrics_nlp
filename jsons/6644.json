(Prayin' so hard)\nCan you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark)\nWas it ever really real\nIf he don't feel like I feel?\n\n[Chorus: Both, Maddie]\nHow does he sleep at night?\nMama, the nerve of this guy\nTo leave me so easy\nAm I gonna be alright?\nHow does he sleep at night?\nMama, the nerve of this guy\nTo leave me so easy\nAm I gonna be alright?\nI wanna kick myself for falling so hard\nMama, can you die from a broken heart?\nA broken heart"
