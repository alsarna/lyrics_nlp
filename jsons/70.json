    "lyrics": "Kiss Of Fire LyricsI touch your lips and all at once the sparks go flying\nThose devil lips that know so well the art of lying\nAnd though I see the danger, still the flame grows higher\nI know I must surrender to your kiss of fire\n\nJust like a torch, you set the soul within me burning\nI must go on, I'm on this road of no returning\nAnd though it burns me and it turns me into ashes\nMy whole world crashes without your kiss of fire\n\nI can't resist you, what good is there in trying\nWhat good is there denying you're all that I desire\nSince first I kissed you my heart was yours completely\nIf I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be\nDon't pity me, don't pity me\nGive me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow\nLove me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow\nI know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me\nThough it consumes me, your kiss of fire\n\nSince first I kissed you my heart was yours completely\nIf I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be\nDon't pity me, don't pity me\n\nGive me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow\nLove me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow\nI know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me\nThough it consumes me\nYour kiss of fireEmbed"
