    "lyrics": "You ask how much I need you\nMust I explain\nI need you, oh, my darling\nLike roses need rain\n\nYou ask how long I'll love you\nI'll tell you true\nUntil the twelfth of never\nI'll still be loving you\n\nHold me close\nNever let me go\nHold me close\nMelt my heart like April snow\n\nI'll love you\nTill the bluebells forget to bloom\nI'll love you\nTill the clover has lost it's perfume\nI'll love you\nTill the poets run out of rhyme\n\nUntil the twelfth of never\nAnd that's a long, long time\nUntil the twelfth of never\nAnd that's a long long time\nThat's a long, long time"
