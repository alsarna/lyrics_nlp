    "lyrics": "Never Can Say Goodbye LyricsI never can say goodbye, no, no, no, I\nI never can say goodbye\n\nEvery time I think I've had enough\nAnd start heading for the door\nThere's a very strange vibration\nPiercing me right to the core\nIt says, \"turn around you fool\nYou know you love him more and more\"\nTell me why is it so\nDon't want to let you go\n\nHey, I never can say goodbye, boy\nOoh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, hey\n\nI never can say goodbye, oh no, I\nI never can say goodbye\nI keep thinking that our problems\nSoon are all gonna work out\nBut there's that same unhappy feeling\nAnd that anguish and that doubt\nIt's that same old dizzy hang-up\nI can't do with you or without\nTell me why is it so\nI don't want to let you go\n\nHey, I never can say goodbye, boy\nOoh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, ooh\nHey, I never can say goodbye, boy\nOoh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, no, no\n\nHey, I never can say goodbye, boy\nNo, no, no, baby, hey, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no\nPlease don't let me say goodbye\nI just cannot say goodbye1Embed"
