    "lyrics": "I don't want my arms around you, no not much\nI don't bless the day I found you, no not much\nI don't need you like the stars don't need the sky\nI won't love you longer than the day I die\nYou don't please me when you squeeze me, no not much\nMy heads the lightest from your very slightest touch\nBaby, if you ever go could I take it maybe so\nOh but would I like it, no not much\nLike a ten cent soda dosen't cost a dime\nI don't want you near me only all time\nYou don't thrill me when you hold me, no not much\nMy brain gets hazy from your cool and crazy touch\nBaby if you ever go could I take it maybe so\nOh but would I like it, no not much\nNo not much"
