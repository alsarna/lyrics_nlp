    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou consider me the young apprentice\nCaught between the Scylla and Charybdis\nHypnotized by you if I should linger\nStaring at the ring around your finger\nI have only come here seeking knowledge\nThings they would not teach me of in college\nI can see the destiny you sold\nTurn into a shining band of gold\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll be wrapped around your finger\nI'll be wrapped around your finger\n\n[Verse 2]\nMephistopheles is not your name\nI know what you're up to just the same\nI will listen hard to your tuition\nYou will see it come to its fruition\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll be wrapped around your finger\nI'll be wrapped around your finger\n\n[Verse 3]\nDevil and the deep blue sea behind me\nVanish in the air, you'll never find me\nI will turn your face to alabaster\nWhen you find your servant is your master\n[Outro]\nOh, you'll be wrapped around my finger\nYou'll be wrapped around my finger\nYou'll be wrapped around my finger\nOhh"
