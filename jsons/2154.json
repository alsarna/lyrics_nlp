(is this the end?)\nWhen will I see you again?\n(When will I see you again?)\nWhen will I see you again, love?\nAre we in love or just friends?\nIs this my beginning or is this the end? (is this the end?)\nWhen will I see you again?\n(When will I see you again?)\nSweet, sweet love of mine\n(When will I see you again?)\nCome on, come on\n(When will I see you again?)\nTell me, yeah\n(When will I see you again?)\nMy sweet lover, yeah\n(When will I see you again?)\nOoh, yeah\n(When will I see you again?)\nCome on, come on\n(When will I see you again?)\nCome on, come on\n(When will I see you again?)\nOoh ooh, yeah\n(When will I see you again?)\n(When will I see you again?)1Embed"
