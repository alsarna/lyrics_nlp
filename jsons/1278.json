    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShapes of things before my eyes\nJust teach me to despise\nWill time make men more wise?\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere within my lonely frame\nMy eyes just hurt my brain\nBut will it seem the same?\n\n[Bridge]\nCome tomorrow, will I be older?\nCome tomorrow, may be a soldier\nCome tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow the trees are almost green\nBut will they still be seen?\nWhen time and tide have been\n\n[Verse 4]\nFall into your passing hands\nPlease don't destroy these lands\nDon't make them desert sands\n\n[Bridge]\nCome tomorrow, will I be older?\nCome tomorrow, may be a soldier\nCome tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 5]\nSoon I hope that I will find\nThoughts deep within my mind\nThat won't disgrace my kind"
