(Boy, you hurtin' that)\nBrooklyn Bay where they birthed me at\nNow I be everywhere, the nerve of rap\nThe audacity to have me with them curtains back\nMe and B., she about to sting, stand back\n[Verse 2: Beyoncé]\nBaby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you\nFrom your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you\nHelplessly, I reminisce, don't want to\nCompare nobody to you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]\nBoy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control\nYour sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go\n\n[Chorus: Beyoncé]\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu\n\n[Verse 3: Beyonce]\nSeeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?\nWhen I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name\nGot a better glimpse and then I looked away\nFeels like I'm losin' it\n[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]\nBoy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control\nYour sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go\n\n[Chorus: Beyoncé]\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu\n\n[Verse 4: Jay-Z]\nYes, Hova's flow so unusual\nBaby girl, you should already know\nIt's H-O, light up the dro\n'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce\nFlow, blow, what's the difference?\nOne you take in vein while the other you sniffin'\nIt's still dope, po-po try to convict him\nThats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'\nLike 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N\nBlow wind, so Chicago of him\nIs he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment\nI don't make the list, don't be mad at me\nI just make the hits like a factory\nI'm just one of one, nothin' after me\nNo Déjà Vu, just me and my... (Oh!)\n[Bridge: Beyoncé]\nBaby, I can't go anywhere\nWithout thinking that you're there\nSeems like you're everywhere, it's true\nGotta be having Deja Vu\n'Cause in my mind I want you here\nGet on the next plane, I don't care\nIs it because I'm missin' you\nThat I'm having Déjà Vu?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]\nBoy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control\nYour sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go\n\n[Chorus: Beyoncé]\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu\nKnow that I can't get over you\n'Cause everything I see is you\nAnd I don't want no substitute\nBaby, I swear it's Déjà Vu5Embed"
