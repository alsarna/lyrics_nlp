I'd be long gone\nThen I wouldn't be doggone\nI'd be long gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow hey, hey, hey!\nI'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing\nAnd I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring\nAnd if we live to be a hundred years old\nIf you ever let that spring turn cold\n\n[Chorus]\nThen I wouldn't be doggone\nHey hey hey! I'd be long gone\nOh I wouldn't be doggone, baby\nI'd be long gone\n\n[Bridge]\nNow did you hear me?\nWell now what I say, oh, believe me\nWell, every woman should try to be\nWhatever her man wants her to be\nAnd I don't want much, all I want from you\nIs for you to be true to me\n[Verse 3]\nI'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend\nOh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end\nThough I know you make me feel like nobody could\nIf I ever found out that you're no good\n\n[Chorus]\nThen I wouldn't be doggone\nI'd be long gone\nWell I wouldn't be doggone\nI'd be long gone\n\n[Outro]\nI wouldn't be doggone\nGone catch me a train\nNo baby, I wouldn't be"
