    "lyrics": "Its now or never; Come hold me tight\nKiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight\nTomorrow will be too late\nIts now or never; My love won't wait\nWhen I first saw you with your smile so tender\nMy heart was captured; My soul surrendered\nI've spent a life time waiting for the right time\nNow that you're near the time is here at last\nIt's now or never; Come hold me tight\nKiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight\nTomorrow will be too late\nIt's now or never; My love won't wait\nJust like a willow we could cry an ocean\nIf we lost true love and sweet devotion\nYour lips excite me; Let your arms invite me\nFor who knows when we'll meet again this way\nIt's now or never; Come hold me tight\nKiss me, my darling; be mine tonight\nTomorrow will be too late\nIt's now or never; My love won't wait"
