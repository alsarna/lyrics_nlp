    "lyrics": "More Love LyricsLet it be soon don't hesitate\nMake it now don't wait\nOpen your heart and let my love come in\nI want the moment to start\nWhen I can fill your heart with\n\nMore love and more joy\nThan age or time could ever destroy\nOh honey now my love will be so sound\nIt'll take a hundred life times\nTo live it down\nWear it down\nTear it down\n\nThis is no fiction this is no act\nThis is real it's a fact\nI'll always belong only to you\nEach day I'll be living to\nMake sure I'm giving you\nMore love and more joy\nThan age or time could ever destroy\nOh honey now my love will be so sound\nIt'll take a hundred life times\nTo live it down\nWear it down\nTear it down\n\nAs we grow older no need to fear\nWhen you need me\nI'll be beside you every step of the way\nA heart that's truthful\nAnd keeping you youthful with\n\nMore love and more joy\nThan age or time could ever destroy\nOh honey now my love will be so sound\nIt'll take a hundred life times\nTo live it down\nWear it down\nTear it downEmbed"
