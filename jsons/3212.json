Could it be spring or fall?\nI walk without a cut through a stained glass wall\n(Weaker in my eyesight)\nWeaker in my eyesight the candle in my grip\n(Words that have no form)\nAnd words that have no form are falling from my lips\n\n[Chorus]\nThese dreams go on when I close my eyes\nEvery second of the night, I live another life\nThese dreams that sleep when it's cold outside\nEvery moment I'm awake, the further I'm away\n(The further I'm away)\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's something out there, I can't resist\nI need to hide away from the pain\nThere's something out there, I can't resist\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe sweetest song is silence that I've ever heard\n(Feet don't touch the earth)\nFunny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth\nIn a wood full of princes, freedom is a kiss\n(The prince hides his face)\nBut the prince hides his face from dreams in the mist\n[Chorus]\nThese dreams go on when I close my eyes\nEvery second of the night, I live another life\nThese dreams that sleep when it's cold outside\nEvery moment I'm awake, the further I'm away\nThese dreams go on when I close my eyes (Every single seâ€”)\nEvery second of the night, I live another life\nThese dreams that sleep when it's cold outside\nEvery moment I'm awake, the further I'm away...3Embed"
