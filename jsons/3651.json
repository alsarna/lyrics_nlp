    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWoke up to the sound of pouring rain\nThe wind would whisper and I'd think of you\nAnd all the tears you cried, that called my name\nAnd when you needed me I came through\n\n[Verse 2]\nI paint a picture of the days gone by\nWhen love went blind and you would make me see\nI'd stare a lifetime into your eyes\nSo that I knew you were there for me\nTime after time you were there for me\n\n[Hook]\nRemember yesterday - walking hand in hand\nLove letters in the sands - I remember you\nThrough the sleepless nights, through every endless day\nI'd wanna hear you say - I remember you\nOh, whoa\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe spent the summer with the top rolled down\nAnd wished ever after would be like this\nYou said \"I love you babe,\" without a sound\nI said I'd give my life for just one kiss\nI'd live for your smile and die for your kiss\n[Hook]\nRemember yesterday - walking hand in hand\nLove letters in the sands - I remember you\nAnd through the sleepless nights, through every endless day\nI'd wanna hear you say - I remember you, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nWe've had our share of hard times, but that's the price we paid\nAnd through it all we kept the promise that we made\nI swear you'll never be lonely\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe woke up to the sound of pouring rain\nWashed away a dream of you\nBut nothing else could ever take you away\n'Cause you'll always be my dream come true\nOh, my darling, I love you\n\n[Hook]\nRemember yesterday - walking hand in hand\nLove letters in the sands - I remember you\nThrough the sleepless nights, through every endless day\nI'd wanna hear you say - I remember you\n\nRemember yesterday - walking hand in hand\nLove letters in the sands - I remember you\nThrough the sleepless nights, through every endless day\nI'd wanna hear you say - I remember, I remember you, yeah"
