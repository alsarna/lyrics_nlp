    "lyrics": "I saw the harbor lights\nThey only told me we were parting\nThe same old harbor lights\nThat once brought you to me\n\nI watched the harbor lights\nHow could I help if tears were starting\nGoodbye to tender nights\nBeside the silvery sea\n\nI long to hold you near\nAnd kiss you just once more\nBut you were on the ship\nAnd I was on the shore\n\nNow I know lonely nights\nFor all the while my heart is whispering\n\"Some other harbor lights\nWill steal your love from me\"\n\nI long to hold you near\nAnd kiss you just once more\nBut you were on the ship\nAnd I was on the shore\n\nNow I know lonely nights\nFor all the while my heart is whispering\n\"Some other harbor lights\nWill steal your love from me\""
