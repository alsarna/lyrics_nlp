    "lyrics": "Baby don't go, pretty baby please don't go\n\nI never had a mother, I hardly knew my dad\nI've been in town for 18 years\nYou're the only boy I've had\nI can't stay, maybe I'll be back some day\n\nBaby don't go, pretty baby please don't go\nI love you so, pretty baby please don't go\n\nI never had no money, I bought at the second hand store\nThe way this old town laughs at me\nI just can't take it no more\nI can't stay, I'm gonna be a lady some day\n\nBaby don't go, pretty baby please don't go\nI love you so, pretty baby please don't go\n\nWhen I get to the city, my tears will all be dry\nMy eyes will look so pretty\nNo one's gonna know I cried\nYes I'm goin' away, maybe I'll be back some day\n\nBaby don't go, maybe I'll be back some day"
