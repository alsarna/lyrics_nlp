    "lyrics": "I guess the time was right for us to say\nWe'd take our time and live our lives\nTogether day by day\nWe'll make a wish and send it on a prayer\nWe know our dreams can all come true\nWith love that we can share\n\nWith you I never wonder\nWill you be there for me?\nWith you I never wonder\nYou're the right one for me\n\n[Chorus]\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\nA love to last my whole life through\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\nForever in my heart\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\n\nWith every kiss, our love is like brand new\nAnd every star up in the sky\nWas made for me and you\nStill, we both know that the road is long\nWe know that we will be together\nBecause our love is strong\n[Chorus]\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\nA love to last my whole life through\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\nForever in my heart\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\n\n[Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\nA love to last my whole life through\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\nForever in my heart\nI finally found the love of a lifetime\n\n[Outro]\n(I finally found the love of a lifetime)\nLove of a lifetime\n(I finally found the love of a lifetime)\nI finally found the love\n(I finally found the love of a lifetime)\nOh, forever in my heart\nI finally found the love of a lifetime"
