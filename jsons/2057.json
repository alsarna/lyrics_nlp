    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can't light no more of your darkness\nAll my pictures seem to fade to black and white\nI'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me\nFrozen here on the ladder of my life\n\n[Verse 2]\nToo late to save myself from falling\nI took a chance and changed your way of life\nBut you misread my meanin' when I met you\nClosed the door and left me blinded by the light\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't let the sun go down on me\nAlthough I search myself, it's always someone else I see\nI'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free\nBut losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can't find, oh, the right romantic line\nBut see me once and see the way I feel\nDon't discard me just because you think I mean you harm\nBut these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't let the sun go down on me\nAlthough I search myself, it's always someone else I see\nI'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free\nBut losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me\n[Chorus]\nDon't let the sun go down on me\nAlthough I search myself, it's always someone else I see\nI'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah\nBut losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me"
