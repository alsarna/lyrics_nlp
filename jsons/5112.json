(Then what am I feeling?)\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nAmor, no es amor (If this ain't love)\nIs this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?\n\n[Verse 2: Frankie J]\nNow, I know you're not my lady but I'm tryna make this right\nI don't know what to do, I'm goin' out of my mind\nSo baby if you let me, kick it wit' you, then well maybe\nWe could ride together, we could do this all night\nNow I don't care if you got a man\nBaby, I wish you'd understand\n'Cause I know he can't love you right (Uh-uh), quite like I can\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]\nWell it's five o'clock in the morning and I still can't sleep\nThinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak\nI'm feeling hopeless at home\nI don't know what to do\nI think I'm in love, baby\n\n[Chorus: Frankie J]\nAmor, no es amor (If this ain't love)\nThen what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nAmor, no es amor (If this ain't love)\nIs this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?\n[Bridge: Frankie J]\nOoh, I love the way you freak it like that\nOoh, I love the way you freak it like that\nOoh, I love the way you freak it like that\nIt's an obsession\n\n[Verse 3: Baby Bash]\nHold up, let me dream\nShorty got me feelin' serene\nYou're my candies and my cream\nGot your boy feeling supreme\nHold up, wait a minute\nBaby, you so damn independent\nLoving everything you representing\nGot a lot of money, and I love to spend it\nAnd that's what's up, and I don't care what people scream\nYou're my blessin' when I'm stressin', my super fly beauty queen\nI'ma keep it saucy 'cause mama know how I do\nWe gon' rendezvous, mi coraz√≥n belongs to you\n\n[Chorus: Frankie J]\nAmor, no es amor (If this ain't love)\nThen what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling? )\nWhat am I doing wrong? (What am I doing wrong?)\nAmor, no es amor (If this ain't love)\nIs this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?\nAmor, no es amor (If this ain't love)\nThen what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling? )\nWhat am I doing wrong? (What am I doing so wrong?)\nAmor, no es amor (If this ain't love)\nIs this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?\n[Outro: Frankie J]\nAmor6Embed"
