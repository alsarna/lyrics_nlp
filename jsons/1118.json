    "lyrics": "In duh valley of duh jolly... (Ho - ho - ho)\n\nHeard about the Jolly Green Giant (potatoes)\nHe's so big and mean (artichoke hearts)\nHe stands there laughin' with his hands on his hips\nAnd then he hits you with a can of beans\n\nHe lives down there in his valley (Brussels sprouts)\nThe cat stands tall and green (spinach)\nWell, he ain't no prize, and there's no women his size\nAnd that's why the cat's so mean\nOne day he left His valley pad\nI mean to say This cat was mad\nNow listen 'round He wasn't gone long\nAnd then he ran into an Amazon\nWell, this changed his whole complexion (broccoli)\nHe had never seen such a beautiful sight (corn)\n\nWell, he looked at her\nAnd she looked at him\nAnd she almost passed out from fright\nHe looked at her Thought, \"what a dilly\"\nHe touched her once She slapped him silly\nThis was something He had never sensed\nHe looked at her As she commenced\nNow listen, pal This ain't no fluke\nI can't see goin' with a big green kook\"\nYou've heard about the Jolly Green Giant (eggplant)\nDon't let his troubles cross your mind (celery stalks)\nHe couldn't get Sally, so went back to his valley\nThe cat was color-blind\n\nMUSIC TO FADE"
