    "lyrics": "I'm taking the shade out of the sun\nWhatever made me think that I was number one\nI oughta know, easy come, easy go\nSittin' it out, I'm spinnin' the dial\nThinkin' about the chump I've been ,I have to smile\nDidn't I know, easy come, easy go\nShe wasn't kind, I wasn't smart\nI lost my mind and fell apart\nI had to find myself in time\nNow I can start all over again\nJust Hangin' around, takin' it slow\nSo happy I found I still can smile and dig the show\nLettin' me know, easy come, easy go"
