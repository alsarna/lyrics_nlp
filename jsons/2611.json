Verse 1]\nWell, it's not far back to sanity\nAt least it's not for me\nAnd if the wind is right you can sail away\nAnd find serenity\n\nOh, the canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nReally, believe me\n\n[Chorus]\nSailing\nTakes me away to where I've always heard it could be\nJust a dream and the wind to carry me\nAnd soon I will be free5Embed"
