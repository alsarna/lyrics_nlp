(KNOCK YOURSELF OUT)\nErnie Maresca\nWop wop wop, wop wop adada dada\nWop wop wop, wop wop adada dada\nWop wop wop, wop wop adada dada\nWop wop wop, wop wop adada dada\nShout Shout knock yourself out..\nComeon yell yell loud and swell\nYou gotta Scream scream you know what I mean\nPut another dime in the record machine..\nHey we're having a party now it's just begun\nWe're all over here and we're having fun..\nJoe's all alone and he wants to be kissed\nWhile Mary's in the corner and she's doing the twist..\nSo Let's Shout Shout knock yourself out..\nComeon yell yell loud and swell\nYou gotta Scream scream you know what I mean\nPut another dime in the record machine..\nHey Play another song like A Runaround Sue\nLet's do a dance that we all can do..\nTurn that jukebox up mighty loud\nLet's liven up this crazy crowd..\nComeon Shout Shout knock yourself out..\nComeon yell yell loud and swell\nYou gotta Scream scream you know what I mean\nPut another dime in the record machine..\nEvery party that I intend\nBelieve now it's the livin end\nMoving and groovin with some friends of mine..\nSaturday night now we're having a time ...\nSo Lets..Shout Shout knock yourself out..\nComeon yell yell loud and swell\nYou gotta Scream scream you know what I mean\nPut another dime in the record machine..\nHey Doing the fly with our hands in the sky..\nYeah, foot stomping baby just a you and I\nSchool was out about a quarter to three\nAnd we're having fun it's plain to see..\nSo Lets..Shout Shout knock yourself out..\nComeon yell yell loud and swell\nYou gotta Scream scream you know what I mean\nPut another dime in the record machine.."
