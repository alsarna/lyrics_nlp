    "lyrics": "You give your hand to me and then you say hello\nAnd I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so\nAnd anyone could tell, you think you know me well\nBut you don't know me\n\nNo, you don't know the one, who dreams of you at night\nAnd longs to kiss your lips, and longs to hold you tight\nTo you I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been\nBut you don't know me\n\nFor I never knew the art of making love\nThough my heart ache with love for you\nAfraid and shy, I let my chance go by\nThe chance you might have loved me too\n\nYou give your hand to me, and then you say goodbye\nI watch you walk away, beside the lucky guy\nTo never, never know, the one who loves you so\nNo, you don't know me\n\nYou give your hand to me, and then you say goodbye\nI watch you walk away, beside the lucky guy\nTo never, never know, the one who loves you so\nNo, you don't know me"
