    "lyrics": "In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox\nWith the best of country music, old and new\nYou can hear your five selections for a quarter\nAnd somebody else's songs when your's are through\n\nI got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter\nAnd my friends around to help me ease the pain\n'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song\nAnd here I am, just missing you again\n\nPlease, mister, please, don't play B-17\nIt was our song, it was his song but it's over\nPlease, mister, please, if you know what I mean\nI don't ever wanna hear that song again\n\nIf I had a dime for every time I held you\nThough you're far away, you've been so close to me\nI could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville\nMaybe even in the state of Tennessee\n\nBut I guess I'd better get myself together\nCause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind\nJust a note that said, \"I'm sorry\", by your picture\nAnd a song that's weighing heavy on my mind\n\nPlease, mister, please, don't play B-17\nIt was our song, it was his song but it's over\nPlease, mister, please, if you know what I mean\nI don't ever wanna hear that song again"
