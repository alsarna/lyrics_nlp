Mmmm\n\nNow I know the rules of the game\nYou hit it once, then break away clean\nI should've never gone back, I know\nBut I had to have just a little bit more\nMy friends laugh, but that's alright\nI may be a fool, but I know what I like\nNow I hate to have to cheat\nBut it feels better when I sneak.  Ow!\nI'm in love (I'm in love)\nWith the other woman\nMy life was fine, (Life was fine)\nYes it was, till she blew my mind\nSomebody help me\nI'm in love, uh huh, (I'm in love)\nWith the other woman.  (With the other woman)\nHey, hey\nMy life was fine, (Life was fine)\nYes it was, till she blew my mind\nMmmm, hmmm.  Whoa, oh\n\nOh, this affair is unique\nAll my life I never met such a freak\nShe keeps me going strong for so long\nWhen I get home, it's all gone\nMakes me wanna grab my guitar\nAnd play with it all night long\n\nOw!\nI'm in love (I'm in love)\nWith the other woman\nMy life was fine, (Life was fine)\nYes it was, till she blew my mind\nMmmm, tell me\nHas anybody else out there ever fell in love\n(Fell in love)\nWith the other woman.  (With the other woman.)\nOh.  With the other woman.  (With the other woman)\nOw!  Say I'm in love (I'm in love)\nWith the other woman.  (With the other woman)\nWith the other woman.  (With the other woman)\nWith the other woman.  (With the other woman)\nI'm in love.  (I'm in love)\nSho'nuff in love"
