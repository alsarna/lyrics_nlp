    "lyrics": "Donâ€™t Expect Me to Be Your Friend LyricsI stopped sending flowers to your apartment\nYou said you aren't at home much anymore\nI stopped dropping by without an appointment\n'Cause I'd hear laughter coming through your door\n\nSometimes late at night you'll still call me\nJust before you close your eyes to sleep\nYou make me vow to try and stop by sometime\nBut baby, that's a promise I can't keep\n\nI love you too much to ever start liking you\nSo let's just let the story kinda end\nI love you too much to ever start liking you\nSo don't expect for me to be your friend\n\nI don't walk down through the village or other places\nThat we used to go to all the time\nI'm trying to erase you from my memory\n'Cause thinking of you jumbles up my mind\nI love you too much to ever start liking you\nSo let's just let the story kinda end\nI love you too much to ever start liking you\nSo don't expect for me to be your friend\n\nYou always act so happy when I see you\nYou smile that way, you take my hand and then...\nIntroduce me to your latest lover\nThat's when I feel the walls start crashing in\n\nI love you too much to ever start liking you\nSo let's just let the story kinda end\nI love you too much to ever start liking you\nSo don't expect for me to be your friendEmbed"
