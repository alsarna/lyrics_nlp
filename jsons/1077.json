    "lyrics": "I love you, there's nothing to hide\nIt's better than burning inside\nI love you, no use to pretend\nThere! I've said it again\n\nI've said it, what more can I say?\nBelieve me, there's no other way\nI love you, I will to the end\nThere! I've said it again\n\nI try to drum up\nA phrase that will sum up\nAll that I feel for you\nBut what good are phrases?\nThe thought that amazes\nIs that you love me and it's heavenly\n\nForgive me for wanting you so\nBut one thing I want you to know\nI've loved you since heaven knows when\nThere! I've said it again\n\nForgive me for wanting you so\nBut one thing I want you to know\nI've loved you since heaven knows when\nThere! I've said it again"
