I can't shut my mouth\nBut when you understand me\nYou might feel good around me\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want your love to bring me down\nI don't want your love so turn it around\n\n[Outro]\nYour rhythm is the power to move me\nIt's something you control completely\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your loveEmbed"
