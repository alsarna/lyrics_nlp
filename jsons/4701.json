Lyrics[Verse 1: Robby]\nBoys and girls, wanna hear a true story?\nSaturday night I was at this real wild party\nThey had the liquor overflowing the cup\nAbout five or six strippers tryna work for a buck\nAnd I took one girl outside with me\nHer name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me\nI said, \"Why you up in there dancin' for cash?\nI guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.\"\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Claudette & Robby]\nWhat would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor\n'Cause he's hungry?\nAnd the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money\nAnd his daddy's gone\nSomewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown\nI ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life\nMmm\n[Verse 2: Ryan Toby]\nGirl, you ain't the only one with a baby\nThat's no excuse to be livin' all crazy\nThen she looked me right square in the eye\nAnd said every day I wake up hopin' to die\nShe said, \"[Nigga], I know about pain 'cause\nMe and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us\nBefore I was a teenager\nI done been through more [shit] that you can't even relate to\"\n\n[Chorus: City High (Ryan)]\nWhat would you do if your son was at home (Oh)\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor (Woahh, woah)\n'Cause he's hungry?\nAnd the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money (Yeah, woah)\nAnd his daddy's gone\nSomewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown\nI ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life\nMmm (Yeah)\n\n[Breakdown: Ryan]\nYo, wait, hold up, hold up, hold up\nHold up, stop the record, yo\nStop the record\nYou should you ain't gonna be going out\nLike this man\n[Bridge: (Claudette) Ryan and Toby]\nHold up!\n(What would you do?)\nGet up on my feet and let go of every excuse\n(What would you do?)\n'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through\n(Come on, what would you do?)\nGet up on my feet and stop making tired excuses\n(What would you do?)\nGirl, I know if my mother can do it, baby, you can do it\n\n[Chorus: City High (Ryan)]\nWhat would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor (Crying all alone, yeah)\n'Cause he's hungry?\nAnd the only way to feed him is to (Only way to feed him)\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money\nAnd his daddy's gone (Nooo)\nSomewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown (Yeah)\nI ain't got a job now (Yeahhh)\nSo for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life\nMmm\n\n[Chorus 2: Robby & Ryan rap-singing]\nWhat would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor\n'Cause he's hungry?\nAnd the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money\nAnd his daddy's gone\nSomewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown\nI ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life\nCome on\n[Chorus: City High]\nWhat would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor\n'Cause he's hungry?\nAnd the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money\nAnd his daddy's gone\nSomewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown\nI ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life\nMmm4Embed"
