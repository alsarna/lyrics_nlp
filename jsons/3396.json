My back's against the wall\nI need you by my side to tell me it's alright\n'Cause I don't think I can take anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this love that I'm feeling?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\nIs this love or am I dreaming?\nThis must be love 'cause it's really got a hold on me\nA hold on me\n\n[Verse 3]\nCan't stop the feeling I've been this way before\nBut with you I've found the key to open any door\nI can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day\nAnd I can't wait to see you again\nSo I can hold you in my arms\n[Chorus]\nIs this love that I'm feeling?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\nIs this love or am I dreaming?\nThis must be love 'cause it's really got a hold on me\nA hold on me\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this love that I'm feeling?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\nIs this love (Is this love) or am I dreaming?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\nIs this love (Is this love) or am I dreaming?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\nIs this love (Is this love) or am I dreaming?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\nIs this love (Is this love) or am I dreaming?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\nIs this love (Is this love) or am I dreaming?\nIs this the love that I've been searching for?\n\n[Outro]\nIs this love?\nIs this love?"
