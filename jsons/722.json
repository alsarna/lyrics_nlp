    "lyrics": "(I Donâ€™t Know Why) But I Do LyricsI don't know why I love you but I do\nI don't know why I cry so but I do\nI only know I'm lonely and that I want you only\nI don't know why I love you but I do\n\nI can't sleep nights because I feel so restless\nI don't know what to do, I feel so helpless\nAnd since you've been away, I cry both night and day\nI don't know why I love you but I do\n\nMy days have been so lonely\nMy nights have been so blue\nI don't know how I manage, but I do\n\nEach night I sit alone and tell myself\nThat I will fall in love with someone else\nI guess I'm wastin' time but I've got to clear my mind\nI don't know why I love you but I doEmbed"
