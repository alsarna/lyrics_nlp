I love it!\nI got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone\nI crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn\nI threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs\nI crashed my car into the bridge, I don't care!\nI love it, I don't care!\nI love it, I love it!\nI don't care! I love it\nI don't care!\n\n[Refrain: Icona Pop]\nYou're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way\nYou want me down on Earth, but I am up in space\nYou're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch\nYou're from the '70s, but I'm a '90s bitch\n\n[Outro: Icona Pop & Charli XCX]\nI don't care! I love it\nI don't care! I love it, I love it\nI don't care! I love it\nI don't care! I love it, I love it\nI don't care! I love it49Embed"
