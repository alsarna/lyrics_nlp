    "lyrics": "[instrumental with whistling]\nWalk along the lake with someone new\nHave yourself a summer fling or two\nBut remember I'm in love with you and\nSave your heart for me\n\nWhen the summer moon is on the rise\nAnd you're dancin' under starlit skies\nPlease don't let stars get in your eyes, just\nSave your heart for me\n\nWhen you're all alone, far away from home\nSomeone's gonna flirt with you-ou\nI won't think it's wrong if you play along\nJust don't fall for someone new\n\nWhen the autumn winds begin to blow\nAnd the summertime is long ago\nYou'll be in my arms again I know, so\nSave your heart for me\nDarlin', save your heart for me\n\nBrief instrumental with whistling-first two lines of a verse\nPlease remember I'm in love with you so\nSave your heart for me\nDarlin', save your heart for me"
