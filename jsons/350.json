    "lyrics": "Melodie d'amour, take this song to my lover\nShoo shoo little bird, go and find my love\nMelodie d'amour, serenade at her window\nShoo shoo little bird, sing my song of love\n\nOh tell her I will wait, if she names a date\nTell her that I care, more than I can bear\nFor when we are apart, how it hurts my heart\nSo fly oh fly away and say that I hope and pray\nThis lovers melody will bring her back to me\n\nMelodie d'amour, take this song to my lover\nShoo shoo little bird, go and find my love\nMelodie d'amour, serenade at her window\nShoo shoo little bird, tell her of my love\n\nOh tell her how I yearn, long for her return\nSay I miss her so, more than she could know\nFor when we are apart, how it hurts my heart\nSo fly oh fly away and say that I hope and pray\nThis lover's melody will bring her back to me\n\nMelodie d'amour, serenade at her window\nShoo shoo little bird, tell her of my love"
