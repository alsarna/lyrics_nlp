    "lyrics": "And when I told her\nI didn't love her anymore\nShe cried (she cried)\nAnd when I told her\nHer kisses were not like before\nShe cried (she cried)\nI thought that our romance was over and done\nBut to her it had just begun\n\nAnd when I told her\nAnother girl had caught my eye\nShe cried (she cried)\nAnd when I kissed her\nA kiss that only meant goodbye\nShe cried (she cried)\n\n(sha-la-la-la sha-la-la)\n\nAnd when I told her\nI didn't love her anymore\nShe cried (she cried)"
