    "lyrics": "Do you remember back in old L.A. (oh oh oh)\nWhen everybody drove a Chevrolet (oh oh oh)\nWhatever happened to the boy next door\nThe sun-tanned crew-cut all-American male\n\nRemember dancing at the high school hop (oh oh oh)\nThe dress I ruined with the soda pop (oh oh oh)\nI didn't recognize the girl next-door\nThe beat up sneakers and the pony tail\n\nBeach baby, beach baby, give me your hand\nGive me something that I can remember\nJust like before, we can walk by the shore in the moonlight\nBeach baby, beach baby, there on the sand\nFrom July to the end of September\nSurfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day\n\nMmm, I never thought that it would end (ooh ooh)\nMmm, and I was everybody's friend (ooh ooh)\nLong hot days\nBlue sea haze\nJukebox plays\nBut now it's fading away\n\nWe couldn't wait for graduation day (oh oh, no)\nWe took the car and drove to San Jose (oh oh oh)\nThat's where you told me that you'd wear my ring\nI guess you don't remember anything\nBeach baby, beach baby, give me your hand (give me your hand)\nGive me somethin' that I can remember (give me something to remember)\nJust like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight\nBeach baby, beach baby, there on the sand (there on the sand)\nFrom July to the end of September (from July to September)\nSurfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day\n\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nDo do, do do do do\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nDo do, do do do do\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nDo do, do do do do\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nDo do, do do do do\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nBeach baby, beach baby\nDo do, do do do do"
