    "lyrics": "There could never be a portrait of my love\nFor nobody can paint a dream\nYou will never see a portrait of my love\nFor miracles are never seen\n\nAnyone who sees her, soon forgets the Mona Lisa\nIt would take, I know, a Michelangelo\nAnd he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above\nTo try and paint a portrait of my love\n\nIt would take, I know, a Michelangelo\nAnd he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above\nTo try and paint a portrait of my love"
