    "lyrics": "[Spoken Intro]\nWhere I was born, everything was dull and dingy\nI lived in a place they called the inner city\nGetting ahead, huh, was strictly a no-no\n'Cause nobody cares what happens to folks that live in the ghetto\n\n[Verse 1]\nThousand of lives wasting away\nPeople living from day to day\nThis is a challenge just staying alive\n'Cause in the ghetto only the strong survives\n\n[Verse 2]\nBroken down homes, kids strung out\nThey don't even know what life's all about\nStealin' cars, robbin' bars\nMuggin', drugs, rat-infested and no one's interested\n\n[Verse 3]\nKids dodgin' cars for recreation\nOnly adds to a mother's frustration\nBreak-ins, folks comin' home and findin' all their possessions gone\nOh ho\n\n[Outro]\nIt's an every day thing - well well - in the ghetto\nIt's an every day thing in the ghetto"
