    "lyrics": "Met the man I love\nIn a town way down in Dixie\n'Neath the stars above\nHe was the sweetest man you ever did see\n\nWhen he held me in his arms\nAnd told me of my many charms\nHe kissed me while the fiddles played\nThe Bonaparte's retreat\n\nAll the world was bright\nWhen he held me on that night\nAnd I heard him say\n\"Please don't ever go away\"\n\nWhen he held me in his arms\nAnd told me of my many charms\nHe kissed me while the fiddles played\nThe Bonaparte's retreat\n\nWhen he held me in his arms\nAnd told me of my many charms\nHe kissed me while the fiddles played\nThe Bonaparte's retreat\n\nAll the world was bright\nWhen he held me on that night\nAnd I heard him say\n\"Please don't you go away\"\nHe's gone and I'll admit I knew\nThat I had met my waterloo\nI knew that he would say a do\nWith Bonaparte's retreat\n\nGoodbye little boy\nGoodbye little Joy\nGoodbye little boy\nSo long little Joy\nGoodbye little boy"
