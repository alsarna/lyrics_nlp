    "lyrics": "Last night your shadow fell upon my lonely room\nI touched your golden hair and tasted your perfume\nYour eyes were filled with love, the way they used to be\nYour gentle hand reached out to comfort me\nThen came the dawn\nAnd you were gone\nYou were gone, gone, gone\n\nI had too much to dream last night\nToo much to dream\nI'm not ready to face the light\nI had too much to dream\nLast night\nLast night\n\nThe room was empty as I staggered from my bed\nI could not bear the image racing through my head\nYou were so real that I could feel your eagerness\nAnd when you raised your lips for me to kiss\n\nCame the dawn\nAnd you were gone\nYou were gone, gone, gone\n\nI had too much to dream last night\nToo much to dream\nI'm not ready to face the light\nI had too much to dream\nLast night\nLast night\nI had too much to dream last night\nToo much to dream\nI'm not ready to face the light\nI had too much to dream\nLast night\nLast night\nOh, too much to dream\nOh, too much to dream\nToo much to dream last night\nOh, too much to dream\nOh, too much to dream\nOh, too much to dream\nI had too much to dream\nOh, too much to dream"
