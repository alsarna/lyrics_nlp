    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen it's cold outside and you want to sleep in\nGo for a pallet that's so nice and thin\nZip it on around while it's on the ground\nSpread it out and lay it on down\n\n[Chorus]\nSlip inside my sleeping bag\nSlip inside my sleeping bag\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're afraid of the dark, baby, no need to be shy\nWe'll talk about some loving while we look at the sky\nDon't be hesitating, it'll be alright\nWe'll tuck it in until it's clean out of sight\n\n[Chorus]\nSlip inside my sleeping bag\nSlip inside my sleeping bag\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet's go out to Egypt because it's in the plan\nSleep beside the Pharaohs in the shifting sand\nWe'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads\nOh, we'll whip out our mattress 'cause there ain't no beds\n[Chorus]\nSlip inside my sleeping bag\nSlip inside my sleeping bag"
