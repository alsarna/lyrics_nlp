    "lyrics": "I'm always late to everything\nI'm sorry\nI'll send a photograph\nI never think of anything\nUntil the moment?s already passed\nI can't be patient\nI don't think it?s working\nI haven?t noticed yet\nI spend my days inside a screen\nThe more I look the worse it gets\nThe worse it gets, the worse it gets\nThe more I look the more I look the worse it gets\n\nI got a car that I call Jenny\nI take her out when there?s too much noise in my head\nShe?s always there to take me anywhere\nJust the same way we do it again\n\nI'm wide-awake and never sleep\nDon?t worry\nI can't control myself\nDon?t wanna make another scene\nJust wanna become someone else\nI can?t decide on anything important\nDon?t tell me I'll forget\nI've seen my face too many times\nThe more I look the worse it gets\nThe worse it gets, the worse it gets\nThe more I look the more I look the worse it gets"
