Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLast night I, I saw you standing\nAnd I started, started pretending\nThat I knew you, and you knew me too\nAnd just like a Roni, you were too shy\nBut you weren't the only, 'cause so was I\nAnd I dreamed of you ever since\nNow I build up my confidence\nGirl next, next time you come my way\nI'll know just what to say...\n\n[Chorus]\nCan we talk for a minute?\nGirl, I want to know your name\nCan we talk for a minute?\nGirl, I want to know your name\n[Verse 2]\nI started to write you letters\nBut I wanted to be more clever\nI wanted to get down and sweet talk you\n\nHey, baby\n\nBut just like a baby, I could not talk\nAnd I tried to come closer, but could not walk\nAnd I think of it every night\nHow I just could not get it right! Oh!\nIf we ever come close again\nI'll know what I'll say then, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nCan we talk for a minute?\nGirl, I want to know your name\nCan we talk for a minute?\nGirl, I want to know your name\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, girl...\nOne more chance with you again\nI will not let it go!\nOh, please! Give me just one more chance for love, love, love, love\n[Chorus]\nCan we talk for a minute?\nGirl, I want to know your name\nCan we talk for a minute?\nGirl, I want to know your name\nCan we talk?\nI wanna talk to my baby\nCome on and talk to me baby\nGirl, I want to know your name\nCan we talk for a minute?\nGirl, I want to know your name\nCan we talk?\nCome on and talk to me baby\nSee I wanna know\nYou better tell me your name baby\nCan we talk for a minute?\nI wanna know, I wanna know\nI want to know your name\nCan we talk for a minute?6Embed"
