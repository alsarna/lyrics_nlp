Who would you die for?\nAnd would you ever kill?\n[Chorus]\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'\nSo I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'\nSo I'm takin' my time on my ride\nTakin' my time on my ride\n\n[Bridge]\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nHelp me\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nHelp me\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'\nSo I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'\nSo I'm takin' my time\nTakin' my time on my ride, woah-oh-oh (Woah, yeah)\nOh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'\nSo I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'\nSo I'm takin' my time on my\n[Outro]\nI've been thinkin' too much\nHelp me\nI've been thinkin' too much\nHelp me\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nHelp me\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nI've been thinkin' too much\nHelp me"
