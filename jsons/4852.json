No\nDo you think I meant to hurt you? No\nSo let’s laugh together, cry together\nGod willin’ we gon’ die together\nDo you think I meant to hurt you? No\nDo you think I meant to hurt you? No\nSo let’s laugh together, cry together\nGod willin’ we gon’ die together\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nIt’s a brand new me, a brand new you\nA brand new day, sky so blue\nHold my hand while I walk with you\nSit on my lap, lemme talk to you\nNo more games callin’ you foul names\nActin’ like females is all the same\nI’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed\nFrom this day forward I’ll never be the same\nI’ma rub your lower back, share my dreams\nI love you, lemme show you what I mean\nGive you the deepest love a girl ever seen\nWatch you sleep, so peaceful and serene\nA toast to the queen, you’re back in my life\nBut this time I’ma do it right\nTrust me, from the bottom of my heart\nNothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise\n[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]\nBaby smile today\nCuz I been imaginin’ more ways\nI’m gon’ luv U better\nWhen your friends’ll see you too\nJust when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do\nI’m gon’ luv U better\nBaby smile today\nCuz I been imaginin’ more ways\nI’m gon’ luv U better\nWhen your friends’ll see you too\nJust when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do\nI’m gon’ luv U better\n\n[Bridge: LL Cool J & Pharrell Williams]\nDo you think I meant to hurt you? No\nDo you think I meant to hurt you? No\nSo let’s laugh together, cry together\nGod willin’ we gon’ die together\nDo you think I meant to hurt you? No\nDo you think I meant to hurt you? No\nSo let’s laugh together, cry together\nGod willin’ we gon’ die together\n\n[Outro: Pharrell Williams]\nThis is for my number one\nThis is for my number one\nTrue baby for I adore4Embed"
