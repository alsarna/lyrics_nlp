sound\nGuaranteed to blow your mind\nSo high you won't come down\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man\nYou've never heard a sound\nLike the rubberband man\nYou're bound to lose control\nWhen the rubberband starts to jam\n\n[Post-Chorus 1]\nOh, this dude is outta sight\nEverything he does\nSeems to come out right\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnce I went to hear him play\nAt a club outside of town\nI was so surprised, I was hypnotized\nBy the sound these cats put down\nWhen I saw this short, fat guy\nStretch a band between his toes\nHey, I laughed so hard\n'Cause the man got down\nWhen it finally reached his nose\n[Chorus]\nHey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man\nYou've never heard a sound\nLike the rubberband man\nYou're bound to lose control\nWhen the rubberband starts to jam\n\n[Post-Chorus 2]\nGot that rubber band, uh\nUp on his toes\nAnd then he wriggled it up\nAll around his nose\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nGuaranteed to blow your mind\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nPlayin' all that music, yet keepin' time\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nWhere in the world did he learn that, oh, Lord\n(Du du du du du)\nLord, help him get away\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man\nYou've never heard a sound\nLike the rubberband man\nYou're bound to lose control\nWhen the rubberband starts to jam\n[Bridge]\nChoo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh\nChoo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo\nChoo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh\nRubberband man, rubberband man, uh\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nDu du du du\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nWatch him, keep movin', just movin'\nGot em groovin' on the corner, it's burnin' up, y'all\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nOhooohooohhh\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man\nYou've never heard a sound\nLike the rubberband man\nYou're bound to lose control\nWhen the rubberband starts to jam\n\n[Verse 3]\nAy, ay, ay, ay\nRubberband man's a doozy\nMove so quick, uh, he make me woozy\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nAnd then he stopped to show down\nHe wiggle it up, he wiggle it down, uh\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nGot speed to move it\nGet rubberband off the ground, uh\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nHe lifted it well high\nIn the sky, y'all\nAnd then he\nDu du du du du\nOh, get with it, y'all\n[Chorus]\nHey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man\nYou've never heard a sound\nLike the rubberband man\nYou're bound to lose control\nWhen the rubberband starts to jam\n\n[Verse 4]\nChoo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh\nTurn it up, turn it up\nChoo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh\nRubberband man, rubberband man, uh\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nHow much of this stuff do he think we can stand, uh, huh?\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nSo much rhythm, grace, and debonair for one man, Lord\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nAnd then he had the nerve to twiggle his left toe\nSlip it through his knee, got the feeling in his head, y'all\n(Du du du du du)\nAw, come on, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, y'all, prepare yourself (won't you prepare yourself, hear me) for the rubberband man\nYou've never heard a sound (never heard a sound)\nLike the rubberband man (Aw, he's the man)\nYou're bound to lose control (and he likes to jam)\nWhen the rubberband starts to jam\n\n[Post-Chorus 3]\nRubberband man starts to jam\nMoving up and down cross the land\nGot the people all in his wake\nEverything probably seems outta place\n\n[Bridge]\nJust move it, just move it\n(Du du du du du du du du)\nJust move, move, move it\nJust, rubberband, rubberband man\nJust move it, just move

rubberband man (Aw, prepare yourself, y'all)\nYou've never heard a sound (Can see his show)\nLike the rubberband man\nYou're bound to lose control (Throwing his hat)\nWhen the rubberband starts to
