(I love you)\nHow can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you)\n\n[Saxophone Riff]\n\n[Chorus 1 & 2/Verse 2]\nI love you\nI love you\nI love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say, can't you see?)\nI love you (Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say, can't you see?)\nI love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me\nSay, can't you see?)\n{How can I tell you about my loved one?}\nI love you (Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me\nSay, can't you see?)\n{How can I tell you about my loved one?}\nI love you\n(I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me\nSay, can't you see?)\n{How can I tell you about my loved one?}\nI love you\n(Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me\nSay, can't you see?)\n{How can I tell you about my loved one?}\n[Saxophone Riff]\n\n[Outro]\nYou'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs\nI look around me and I see it isn't so, oh, no\nSome people want to fill the world with silly love songs\nAnd what's wrong with that?4Embed"
