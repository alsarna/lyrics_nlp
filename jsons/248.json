    "lyrics": "Picnic LyricsOn a picnic morning\nWithout a warning\nI looked at you\nAnd somehow I knew\n\nOn a day for singing\nMy heart went winging\nA picnic grove\nWas our rendezvous\n\nYou and I in the sunshine\nWe strolled the fields and farms\nAt the last light of evening\nI held you in my arms\n\nNow when days grow stormy\nAnd lonely for me\nI just recall\nPicnic time with you\nNow when days grow stormy\nAnd lonely for me\nI just recall\nPicnic time with youEmbed"
