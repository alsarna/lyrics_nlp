    "lyrics": "[JUDAS]\nEvery time I look at you, I don't understand\nWhy you let the things you did get so out of hand\nYou'd have managed better if you'd had it planned\nWhy'd you choose such a backward time and such a strange land?\nIf you'd come today, you would have reached a whole nation\nIsrael in 4 BC had no mass communication\nDon't you get me wrong - I only wanna know\n\n[CHOIR]\nJesus Christ, Jesus Christ\nWho are you? What have you sacrificed?\nJesus Christ, Jesus Christ\nWho are you? What have you sacrificed?\nJesus Christ, Superstar\nDo you think you're what they say you are?\nJesus Christ, Superstar\nDo you think you're what they say you are?\n\n[JUDAS]\nTell me what you think about your friends at the top\nWho'd you think, besides yourself, was the pick of the crop?\nBuddha, was he where it's at? Is he where you are?\nCould Muhammad move a mountain, or was that just PR?\nDid you mean to die like that? Was that a mistake, or\nDid you know your messy death would be a record-breaker?\nDon't you get me wrong - I only wanna know\n[CHOIR]\nJesus Christ, Jesus Christ\nWho are you? What have you sacrificed?\nJesus Christ, Jesus Christ\nWho are you? What have you sacrificed?\nJesus Christ, Superstar\nDo you think you're what they say you are?\nJesus Christ, Superstar\nDo you think you're what they say you are?"
