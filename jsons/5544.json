(Gucci, Gucci!)\nWhen this loving is so good\nWhy would you wanna break up? (Sean Garrett the Pen)\nIf I hit that so good\nWhy would you wanna break up? (Gucci!)\nIf the feeling is so good\nWhy would you wanna break up? (We goin' in!, oh!)\n\n[Chorus: Mario & Sean Garrett]\nLovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you\nWhen I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you\nWhy would you wanna break up? Do anything for you\nWhy would you wanna break up?\nSee I be driving through your hood\nWhy would you wanna break up?\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nNow baby girl done dumped me, she no longer wants me\nI'm no longer hired, she said that I been fired\nOn to the next one, more fish in the sea\nGirls are like buses: miss one, next fifteen, one comin' (Huh)\nGucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin' (Burr!)\nSwag so stupid but the bitch straight dumped me\nOver, no more smoking doja\nBaby girl went AWOL, she used to be my soldier\n\n[Verse 2: Mario]\n(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci?\n(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louie?\n(Don't) Don't I make your earlobe freeze?\n(Don't) Don't when I dive, I dive deep?\nI know I be (Gone) I know I be (Gone)\nI know I be (Flirting with them girls)\nI know I be (Said I be right back but take too long)\nI know I be (Saying I be faithful but I don't)\nI know I be making you them promises\nThen breaking your heart again\nTelling you she wasn't who she was then we arguing\nBut baby, I love you (Oh!)\n\n[Chorus: Mario & Sean Garrett]\nLovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you\nWhen I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you\nWhy would you wanna break up?
