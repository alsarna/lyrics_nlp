    "lyrics": "Who's goin' to ride that chrome three-wheeler?\nWho's goin' to make that first mistake?\nWho wants to wear those gypsy leathers\nAll the way to Fire Lake?\n\nWho wants to break the news about Uncle Joe?\nYou remember Uncle Joe\nHe was the one afraid to cut the cake\nWho wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah\nJoe's run off to Fire Lake?\nJoe's run off to Fire Lake\n\nWho wants to brave those bronzed beauties\nLyin' in the sun\nWith their long soft hair falling\nFlying as they run\nAh they smile so shy and they flirt so well\nAnd they lay you down so fast\nTill you look straight up and say\nOh lord, am I really here at last?\n\nWho wants to play those eights and aces?\nWho wants a raise, who needs a stake?\nWho wants to take that long-shot gamble\nAnd head out for Fire Lake?\nHead out\nWho wants to go to Fire Lake\nHead out\nWho wants to go to Fire Lake\nHey, head out\nWho wants to go to Firelake\nHead out, head out\nWho wants to go to Fire Lake\nOut to Fire Lake\nAll right! Who wants to do it?\nWho wants to go to Fire Lake?\n\nWho wants to do it?\nWho wants to go to Fire Lake?\nWho wants to do it now?\nWho wants to go to Fire Lake?\nWho wants to go to Fire Lake?\nHey, who wants to head out, head out?"
