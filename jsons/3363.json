    "lyrics": "Heat of the Night LyricsI was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream\nWhere one man's nightmare is another man's dream\nPull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light\nBetter leave it alone in the heat of the night\nMet a man with a message from the other side\nCouldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind\nHe said it's up to you\nYou can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)\nBetter leave it alone in the heat of the night\n\nIn the heat of the night they'll be comin' around\nThey'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down\nIn the heat of the night\n(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)\n(Don't look back don't ever turn around)\nHad to pay the piper to call the tune\nSaid he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon\nPull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right\nWhen you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night1Embed"
