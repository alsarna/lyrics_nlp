    "lyrics": "The wheel of fortune\nGoes spinning around\nWill the arrow point my way?\nWill this be my day?\n\nOh, wheel of fortune\nPlease don't pass me by\nLet me know the magic of\nA kiss and a sigh\n\nWhile the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning\nI'll not dream of winning\nFortune or fame\nWhile the wheel is turning, turning, turning\nI'll be yearning, yearning\nFor love's precious flame\n\nOh, wheel of fortune\nI'm hoping somehow\nIf you'll ever smile on me\nPlease let it be now\n\nWhile the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning\nI'll not dream of winning\nFortune or even fame\nWhile the wheel is turning, turning, turning\nI'll be yearning, yearning\nFor love's precious flame\nOh, wheel of fortune\nI'm hoping somehow\nIf you ever smile on me\nPlease let it be now"
