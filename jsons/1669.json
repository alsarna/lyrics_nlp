    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nCome Saturday morning\nI'm going away with my friend\nWill Saturday spend more than half of the day?\n\n[Verse 1]\nJust I and my friend\nWe'll wander for miles\nIn our Saturday smiles\nAnd then we'll move on\nBut we will remember\nLong after Saturday's gone\n\n[Chorus]\nCome Saturday morning\nI'm going away with my friend\nWe'll wander for miles\nIn our Saturday smiles\n\n[Outro]\nJust I and my friend\nDressed up in our rings\nAnd our Saturday things\nAnd then we'll move on\nBut we will remember\nLong after Saturday's gone"
