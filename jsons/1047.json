Is he picking you up after school today?\n-M-m\n-By the way, where'd you meet him?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI met him at the candy store\nHe turned around and smiled at me\nYou get the picture?\n-Yes, we see\nThat's when I fell for the Leader of the Pack\n\nMy folks were always putting him down\n-Down, down\nThey said he came from the wrong side of town\n-What you mean when you say that he came from the wrong side of town?\nThey told me he was bad\nBut I knew he was sad\nThat's why I fell for the Leader of the Pack\n\nOne day my Dad said, \"Find someone new\"\nI had to tell my Jimmy, \"We're through\"\n-What you mean when you say that you better go find somebody new?\nHe stood there and asked me why\nBut all I could do was cry\nI'm sorry I hurt you, the Leader of the Pack\nHe sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye\nThe tears were beginning to show\nAs he drove away on that rainy night\nI begged him to go slow\nWhether he heard\nI'll never know\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nLook out, look out, look out, look out\n\nI felt so helpless, what could I do?\nRemembering all the things we've been through\nIn school they all stop and stare\nI can't hide my tears, but I don't care\nI'll never forget him, the Leader of the Pack\n\nOoh, ooh-ooh-ooh\n\nLeader of the Pack, now he's gone\nLeader of the Pack, now he's gone\nLeader of the Pack, now he's gone\nLeader of the Pack, now he's gone"
