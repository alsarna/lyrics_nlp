    "lyrics": "A little love that slowly grows and grows\nNot one that comes and goes\nThat's all I want from you\n\nA sunny day with bolts up to the sky\nA kiss and no goodbye\nThat's all I want from you\n\nDon't let me down, oh show me that you care\nRemember when you give, you also get your share\nDon't let me down, I have no time to waste\nTomorrow might not come, when dreamers dream too late\n\nA little love that slowly grows and grows\nNot one that comes and goes\nThat's all I want from you\n\nDon't let me down, oh show me that you care\nRemember when you give, you also get your share\nDon't let me down, I have no time to waste\nTomorrow might not come, when dreamers dream too late\n\nA little love that slowly grows and grows\nNot one that comes and goes\nThat's all I want from you\nThat's all I want from you"
