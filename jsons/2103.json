(Love won't let me wait)\nOh, baby, every time we meet\nOh, yeah\nAnd love won't let- (Love won't let me wait)\nIt won't let me wait\nNo, no\nLove won't let me wait\nLove won't let- (Love won't let me wait)\nIt won't let me wait, listen, sugar\nNo, baby\nLove won't let- (Love won't let me wait)\nIt won't let me wait, no, baby\nNo, no\nCan't you feel the fire? (Love won't let me wait)\nOf your love, I'm never tired\nNo, baby\n'Cause love won't let me wait\nMy temperature's rising\n'Cause you're so tantalizingEmbed"
