    "lyrics": "The more I see you, the more I want you\nSomehow this feeling just grows and grows\nWith every sigh I become more mad about you\nMore lost without you and so it goes\n\nCan you imagine how much I love you?\nThe more I see you as years go by\nI know the only one for me can only be you\nMy arms won't free you, and my heart won't try\n\nCan you imagine how much I love you?\nThe more I see you as years go by\nI know the only one for me can only be you\nMy arms won't free you, and my heart won't try"
