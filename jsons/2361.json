    "lyrics": "I Never Cry LyricsIf there is a tear on my face\nIt makes me shiver to the bone\nIt shakes me, Babe\nIt's just a heartache that got caught in my eye\nAnd you know I never cry, I never cry\n\nSometimes I drink more than I need\nUntil the TV's dead and gone\nI may be lonely\nBut I'm never alone\nAnd the night may pass me by\nBut I'll never cry\n\nTake away, take away my eyes\nSometimes I'd rather be blind\nBreak a heart, break a heart of stone\nOpen it up but don't you leave it alone\n'Cuz that's all I got to give you\nBelieve me Babe, it ain't been used\nMy heart's a virgin, it ain't ever  been tried\nAnd you know I'll never cry\nAnd you know I'll never cry\nAnd you know I'll never cry\nNever cry, I'll never cry\n\nBreak a heart, break a heart of stone\nOpen it up but don't leave, don't you leave me alone\n'Cuz that's all I got to give you\nBelieve me Babe, it ain't been used\nMy heart's a virgin, it ain't never been tried\nAnd you know I'll never cry\nNever cry\nI'll never cryEmbed"
