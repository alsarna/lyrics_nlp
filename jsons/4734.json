Why?\n\n[Verse 1: Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, Both]\nThere you are, in a darkened room\nAnd you're all alone, looking out the window\nYour heart is cold and lost the will to love\nLike a broken arrow\nHere I stand in the shadows (In the shadows)\nCome to come, come to me\nCan't you see that...\n\n[Chorus: Ricky Martin & Christina Aguilera]\nNobody wants to be lonely?\nNobody wants to cry\nMy body's longing to hold you\nSo bad, it hurts inside\nTime is precious and it's slipping away\nAnd I've been waiting for you all of my life\nNobody wants to be lonely\nSo why (Why), why don't you let me love you?\nWhy, why, oh, why?\n[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera & Ricky Martin, Both]\nCan you hear my voice? Do you hear my song?\nIt's a serenade, so your heart can find me, oh\nAnd suddenly, you're flying down the stairs\nInto my arms, baby, oh\nBefore I start going crazy (Goin' crazy)\nRun to me (Run to me) 'cause I'm dying\n\n[Chorus: Ricky Martin & Christina Aguilera]\nNobody wants to be lonely (Wants to be lonely)\nNobody wants to cry\nMy body's longing to hold you (I'm longing to hold you)\nSo bad it hurts inside\nTime is precious and it's slipping away\nAnd I've been waiting for you all of my life\nNobody wants to be lonely\nSo why (Why), why don't you let me love you?\n\n[Bridge: Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, Both]\nI wanna feel you need me (Feel you need me)\nJust like the air you're breathing (Breathing)\nI need you here in my life\nDon't walk away, don't walk away\nDon't walk away, walk away\nNo, no, no, no\nNobody wants to be lonely\nNobody wants to cry, yeah, yeah\n[Chorus: Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, Both]\nNobody wants to be lonely (Yeah, oh)\nNobody wants to cry (Nobody wants to cry)\nMy body's longing to hold you (It's longing to hold you)\nSo bad, it hurts inside\nTime is precious and it's slipping away\nAnd I've been waiting for you all of my life\nNobody wants to be lonely\nSo why (Why), why don't you let me love you?\nNobody wants to be lonely\nNobody wants to cry (Nobody wants to cry)\nMy body's longing to hold you (I'm longing to hold you)\nSo bad, it hurts inside1Embed"
