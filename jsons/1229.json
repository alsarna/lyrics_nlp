    "lyrics": "You might wake up some mornin'\nTo the sound of something moving past your window in the wind\nAnd if you're quick enough to rise\nYou'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow\nOut on the new horizon\nYou may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings\nAnd if the sleep has left your ears\nYou might hear footsteps running through an open meadow\n\nDon't be concerned, it will not harm you\nIt's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of\nAcross my dreams with nets of wonder\nI chase the bright elusive butterfly of love\n\nYou might have heard my footsteps\nEcho softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind\nI might have even called your name\nAs I ran searching after something to believe in\nYou might have seen me runnin'\nThrough the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind\nIf you remember something there\nThat glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'\n\nDon't be concerned, it will not harm you\nIt's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of\nAcross my dreams with nets of wonder\nI chase the bright elusive butterfly of love\nAcross my dreams with nets of wonder\nI chase the bright elusive butterfly of love"
