    "lyrics": "April Love LyricsApril love is for the very young\nEvery star's a wishing star that shines for you\nApril love is all the seven wonders\nOne little kiss can tell you this is true\n\nSometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers\nRain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet\nBut April love can slip right through your fingers\nSo if she's the one, don't let her run away\n\nSometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers\nRain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet\nBut April love can slip right through your fingers\nSo if she's the one, don't let her run awayEmbed"
