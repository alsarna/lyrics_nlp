Pharrell Williams Cover) LyricsLike the legend of the phoenix, huh\nAll ends with beginnings\nWhat keeps the planets spinning, ah\nThe force from the beginning, huh, love\n\nWe've come too far\nTo give up who we are\nSo let's raise the bar\nAnd our cups to the stars\n\nShe's up all night to the sun\nI'm up all night to get some\nShe's up all night for good fun\nI'm up all night to get lucky\n\nWe're up all night to the sun\nWe're up all night to get some\nWe're up all night for good fun\nGet lucky!\nSkate backwards!\n\nWe've come too far\nTo give up who we are\nSo let's raise the bar\nAnd our cups to the stars\n\nShe's up all night to the sun\nI'm up all night to get some\nShe's up all night for good fun\nI'm up all night to get lucky\n\nWe're up all night to the sun\nWe're up all night to get some\nWe're up all night for good fun\nWe're up all night to get lucky\n\nWe're up all night to get lucky\nWe're up all night to get lucky\nWe're up all night to get lucky\nWe're up all night to get lucky\n\nUp all night to get lucky\nUp all night to get lucky\nUp all night to get luckyEmbed"
