    "lyrics": "In my life\nI've felt so self assured\nBut suddenly it's all changed\nShe's a cloud\nThat hangs above my world\nAnd I find myself wandering in the rain\nAnd now I can't go on\n\n'Cause I am lost\nLiving inside myself\nLiving inside this shell\nLiving outside your love\nI am lost\nSomewhere inside my own dreams\nAfraid of what life really means\nLiving without your love\n\nI need her guiding light\nTo shine on my darkest days\nI was young, and time was on my side\nBut like a fool I let it slip away\nAnd now those days are gone\n\nAnd I am lost\nLiving inside myself\nLiving inside this shell\nLiving outside your love\nI am lost\nSomewhere inside my own dreams\nAfraid of what life really means\nLiving without your love\nIn my life\nI've felt so self-assured\nBut oh how the seasons change\nAnd now I'm not that strong\n\n'Cause I am lost\nLiving inside myself\nLiving inside this hell\nLiving outside your love\nI am lost\nSomewhere inside my own dreams\nAfraid of what life really means\nLiving without your love\n\nI am lost\nLiving inside myself\nLiving inside this shell\nLiving outside your love\nI am lost"
