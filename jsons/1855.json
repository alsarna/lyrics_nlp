(Yes, I can)\nAnd I've been waiting such a long time\nFor Saturday\n\n[Verse 2: Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Both]\nAnother day in the park\nI think it was the Fourth of July\nAnother day in the park\nI think it was the Fourth of July\nPeople talking, really smiling\nA man playing guitar\nSinging for us all\n[Chorus: Robert Lamm (Peter Cetera)]\nWill you help him change the world\nCan you dig it? (Yes, I can)\nAnd I've been waiting such a long time\nFor today\n\n[Bridge: Both]\nSlow motion riders fly the colours of the day\nA bronze man still can tell stories his own way\nListen children, all is not lost\nAll is not lost, oh no oh\n\n[Verse 3: Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Both]\nFunny days in the park\nEvery day's the Fourth of July (Yes it is)\nFunny days in the park\nEvery day's the Fourth of July\nPeople reaching, really touching\nA real celebration\nWaiting for us all\n\n[Chorus: Robert Lamm (Peter Cetera)]\nIf you want it, really want it\nCan you dig it? (Yes, I can)\nAnd I've been waiting such a long time\nFor the day, yeah yeah yeah5Embed"
