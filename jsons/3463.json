You can call me anything you want\nCall me baby Call me Just call me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see you with me and baby makes three\nI see me with you and all the things we do\nForget the weather we should always be together\nI need you as my guide and my light\nMy love is a flame that burns in your name\nWe'll be together We'll be together tonight\n[Chorus 2]\nWe'll be together, yeah\nWe'll be together, yeah\nWe'll be together, yeahEmbed"
