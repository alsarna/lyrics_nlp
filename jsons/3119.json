    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMarvin, he was a friend of mine\nAnd he could sing a song, his heart in every line\nMarvin sang of the joy and pain\nHe opened up our minds, and I still can hear him say\n\"Aw talk to me, so you can see, what's going on\"\nSay you will sing your songs forevermore\n\n[Refrain]\nGonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift\nI bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd\nGonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift\nYou found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift\nYou found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift\n\n[Verse 2]\nJackie, hey what'you doing now?\nIt seems like yesterday when we were working out\nJackie, you set the world on fire\nYou came and gifted us, your love it lifted us higher and higher\nKeep it up and we'll be there at your side\nSay you will sing your songs forevermore\n\n[Refrain]\nGonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift\nI bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd\nGonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift\nYou found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift\nGonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift\nI bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd\nGonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift\nYou found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift\nGonna miss your sweet voice, that soulful voice, on the nightshift\nWe all remember you, your songs are coming through\nAnd at the end of a long day, it's gonna be okay, on the nightshift\nYou found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift"
