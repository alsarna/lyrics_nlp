    "lyrics": "Night is dragging her feet\nI wait alone in the heat\nI know, know that you'll have your way\n'Til you have to go home\nNo's a word I can't say\nCause it gets me nowhere to tell you no\nAnd it gets me nowhere to make you go\nWill a little more love make you stop depending?\nWill a little more love bring a happy ending?\nWill a little more love make it right?\nWill a little more love make it right?\n\nWhere, where did my innocence go?\nHow, how was a young girl to know?\nI'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes\nIn the warmth of your arms, in the web of your lies\n\nBut it gets me nowhere to tell you no\nAnd it gets me nowhere to make you go\n\nWill a little more love make you stop depending?\nWill a little more love bring a happy ending?\nWill a little more love make it right?\nWill a little more love make it right?\nGets me nowhere to tell you no\nIt gets me nowhere to make you go\n\nWill a little more love make you stop depending?\nWill a little more love bring a happy ending?\nWill a little more love make it right?\nWill a little more love make it right?\n\nGets me nowhere to tell you no\nIt gets me nowhere to make you go\n\nWill a little more love make you stop depending?\nWill a little more love bring a happy ending?\nWill a little more love make it right?\nWill a little more love make it right?\n\nGets me nowhere to tell you no\nIt gets me nowhere to make you go"
