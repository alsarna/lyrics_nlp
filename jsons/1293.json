    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was born in Lil' Rock\nHad a childhood sweetheart\nWe were always hand in hand\nI wore hightop shoes and shirt tails\nSuzy was in pigtails\nI knew I loved her even then\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know my papa disapproved it\nMy mama boo-hooed it\nBut I told them time and time again\n\"Don't you know I was made to love her\nBuild my world all around her\"\nYeah! Hey, hey, hey\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe's been my inspiration\nShowed appreciation\nFor the love I gave her through the years\nLike a sweet magnolia tree\nMy love blossomed tenderly\nMy life grew sweeter through the years\n\n[Verse 4]\nI know that my baby loves me\nMy baby needs me\nThat's why we made it through the years\nI was made to love her\nWorship and adore her\nHey, hey, hey\n[Verse 5]\nAll through thick and thin\nOur love just won't end\n'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey\nMy baby loves me\nMy baby needs me\nAnd I know I ain't going nowhere\n\n[Verse 6]\nI was knee-high to a chicken\nWhen that love bug bit me\nI had the fever with each passing year\nOh, even if the mountain tumbles\nIf this whole world crumbles\nBy her side I'll still be standing there\n\n[Verse 7]\n'Cause I was made to love her\nI was made to live for her, yeah!\nAh, I was made to love her\nBuild my world all around her\nHey, hey, hey\nOoh baby, I was made to please her\nYou know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no\nHey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby"
