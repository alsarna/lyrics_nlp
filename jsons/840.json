You know, and they'd been carrying on for some time now behind the Sultan's back and you could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert air and he'd say (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, \"stop, Clyde!\" and Clyde would say, (imitate camel voice). Which is camel for, \"What the heck did he say anyway?\"\nWell....\n\nHe brought that camel to a screeching halt\nAt the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde\nSnuck around the corner and into the tent he went\nThere he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug\nWearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes\nAnd a bone in her nose ho, ho\nSpoken\nThere she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate, bowl of chitterlings, two bananas, three Hershey bars, sipping on a \"R C\" Co-Cola listening to her transistor, watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung, \"Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?\" and Ahab walked up to her and he said, (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, \"Let's twist again like we did last summer, baby.\" (laughter) You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug, give him one of the sly looks, she said, (coy, girlish laugh) \"Crazy baby\"\n'Round and around and around and around...etc\n\nAnd that's the story 'bout Ahab the Arab\nThe Sheik of the Burnin' sand\nAhab the Arab\nThe swinging Sheik of the burnin' sandEmbed"
