    "lyrics": "Somewhere, My Love LyricsSomewhere my love there will be songs to sing\nAlthough the snow covers the hope of Spring\nSomewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold\nAnd there are dreams, all than your heart can hold\nSomeday we'll meet again, my love\nSomeday whenever the Spring breaks through\n\nYou'll turn to me out of the long-ago\nWarm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow\nLara, my own, think of me now and then\nGodspeed, my love, till you are mine again\n\nWarm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow\nGodspeed, my love, till you are mine againEmbed"
