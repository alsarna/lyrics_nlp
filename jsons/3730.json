Lyrics[Intro: Freedom Williams]\nThings that make you go, hmm\n\n[Verse 1: Freedom Williams]\nI was at the crib, sittin' by the fireplace\nDrinkin' cocoa on the bear skin rug\nThe door bell rang, who could it be?\nThought to myself then started to shrug\nGot to the door, ding dong, \"Who is it?\"\nMy girl's best friend had paid me a visit\nSly as can be tight dress and all\nShe knew that I was faithful, I really didn't have the gall\nI tried to chill, she made the move\nNow, I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve\nI didn't realize my girl was settin' me up\nYo, my girlfriend didn't trust me, no\nYeah, but she lost control, I wouldn't take the bait\nI said, \"Chill baby, baby chill baby, baby wait\"\nMy girl bust in, caught us creatin' a boom\nShe said, \"Girlfriend?!\"\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm, hey\nThings that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Verse 2: Freedom Williams]\nHere's how it started, just an example\nOf how another brother can trample\nRuin your life, sleep with your wife\nWatch your behind there was a friend of mine\nNamed Jay, would come over late at night and say, \"Hey\nI'll watch the fight\", I thought it was alright\n'Cause me and Jay we were really really tight\nSo damned close we had the same blood type\nMonths went by and my wife got big\nWe were havin' a child and I got another gig\nSo I let Jay move into the crib and chill\nHe had his own room and helped pay the bills\nThe time had come baby doll to conceive\nIt looked like Jay and I couldn't believe\nBefore my eyes in the delivery room\n\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThe things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nRobi-Rob, break it down\n[Breakdown: Martha Wash]\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\n\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\n\n[Verse 3: Freedom Williams]\nSeventeen and I was havin' a ball\nEleventh grade and yo, I knew it all\nI fell in love for the very first time\nWith this girl she really blew my mind\nInnocence and whole lotta class\nStyle  that could give you whiplash\nShe said, \"Hello\" and my heartbeat stopped\nShe was the world and I was on top\nTime went by, she filled my universe\nWe made love, she said I was the first\nMy boy kept tellin' me, yo, I don't know\nI think your girl's been playin' tic tac toe\nI'll ask my girl I know she only loves me\nWasn't I the one who took your virginity?\nThe look on her face read sorrow and gloom\nShe said, \"Yeah, why do you guys always ask that?\"\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\n\n[Verse 4: Freedom Williams]\nHey ladies, have you ever had a man\nGo away for business, come back with a tan\nComes home late at night from work\nYou cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk\nSayin' he didn't have time to eat\nAnd he's not even hungry, he wants to go to sleep\nTo the bedroom he said his head hurts\nYou're only makin' love in radical spurts\nMysterious calls and the phone goes click\nYou say to yourself, \"I'm gonna hit him with a brick\nAin't no way he could be cheatin' on me\nI wonder who bought him those B.V.D.'s\nDressed to a T to hang with the fellas\nOut with the guys and I'm gettin' jealous\nComin' home late smellin' like perfume, fume\n\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, oh, oh, yeah\nThe things that make you go, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\n\n[Chorus: Martha Wash]\nThings that make you go, hmm\nHmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nHmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm\nThings that make you go, hmm\nIt's the things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm...Embed"
