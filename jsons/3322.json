    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nI\nI was a game he would play\nHe brought the clouds to my day\nThen like a ray of light\nYou came my way one night\n\nJust one look\nAnd I knew\nYou would make everything clear\nMake all the clouds disappear\n\nPut all your fears to rest\nWho do I love the best?\nDon't you know\nDon't you know\n\n[Chorus:]\nYou got it all over him\nYou got me over him\nHoney, it's true\n\nThere's just you\nYou must have been heaven sent\nHearing me call you went\nOut on a limb\nAnd you're all that he's not\nJust look what I got\n'Cause you got it all\nOver him\n\n[Verse 2:]\nNo\nDon't let him worry you so\nOnce I met you I let go\nOh, you can surely see\nYou're so much more to me\n\nJust one look\nAnd I knew\nYou would make everything clear\nMake all the clouds disappear\n\nYou're better than all the rest\nWho do I love the best\nDon't you know\nDon't you know\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]"
