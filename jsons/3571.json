    "lyrics": "What would I have to do\nTo get you to notice me too\nDo I stand in line\nOne of a million admiring eyes\n\nWalk a tightrope way up high\nWrite your name across the sky\n\nI'm going crazy just to let you know\nYou'd be amazed how much I love you so baby\nWhen I get my hands on you, I won't let go\nThis time I know it's for real\n\nShould I write or call your home\nShout it out with a megaphone\nRadio, TV news\nGot to find a way to get the message to you\n\nSay I love you with a neon sign\nAnything to make you mine\n\nI'm going crazy just to let you know\nIf I wait too long for you, I might explode\nI've been around the block enough to know\nThis time I know it's for real\nOoo, baby\nThis time, this time......\nThis time, this time......\nOoo, baby\nThis time, this time......\nOoo, baby\nWalk a tightrope way up high\nWrite your name across the sky\n\nI'm going crazy just to let you know\nYou'd be amazed how much I love you so, baby\nWhen I get my hands on you, I won't let go\nThis time I know it's for real\n\nI'm going crazy just to let you know\nIf I wait too long for you, I might explode, oh baby\nI've been around the block enough to know\nThis time I know it's for real"
