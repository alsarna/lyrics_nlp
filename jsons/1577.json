    "lyrics": "Darling, I don't know much\nBut I know I love you so much\nMy life depends on your touch\n\nAnd my love is a river running soul deep\nWay down inside me, it's-a soul deep\nIt's too big to hide\nAnd it can't be denied\nMy love is a river running soul deep\n\nI'll work myself to death for you\nJust to show I adore you\nNothing I wouldn't do for you\n\n'Cause my love is a river running soul deep\nWay down inside me, it's-a soul deep\nIt's too big to hide\nAnd it can't be denied\nMy love is a river running soul deep\n\nAll I ever, ever hope to be\nDepends on your love for me\nBaby, believe me\nIf you should leave me\nI'd be nothing but an empty shell\nI know darn well, I can tell, now\nI don't know much\nBut I know I love you so much\nMy life depends on your touch\n\nAnd my love is a river running soul deep\nWay down inside me, it's-a soul deep\nIt's too big to hide and it can't be denied\nMy love is a river running soul deep\n\nMy love is a river running soul deep\nWay down inside me, it's-a soul deep\nMy love is a river running soul deep\nWay down inside me, it's-a soul deep\nWell, my love is a river running soul deep\nWay down inside me, it's-a soul deep"
