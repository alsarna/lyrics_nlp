Am I here? Where are you?\nWhat's in back of the sky? Why do we cry?\n[Verse 3]\nGotta get off, gonna get\nOut of this merry-go-round\nGotta get on, gonna get\nNeed to get on where I'm bound\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhen did I get, where did I\nWhy am I lost as a lamb?\nWhen will I know, where will I\nHow will I learn who I am?\n\n[Bridge]\nIs this a dream? Am I here? Where are you?\nTell me\n\n[Outro]\nWhen will I know, how will I know\nWhen will I know why?Embed"
