(I really need you.)\nBaby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)\nAlthough you're never near, (I really need you.)\nYour voice I often hear.  (I really need you.)\nAnother day, another night, (I really need you.)\nI long to hold you tight, (I really need you.)\n'Cause I'm so lonely\n\nBaby, I need your loving\nGot to have all your loving\nBaby, I need your loving\nGot to have all your loving\n\nSome say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg\nThan weak, I'd rather be\nIf it means having you to keep\n'Cause lately I've been losing sleep\n\nBaby, I need your loving\nGot to have all your loving\nBaby, I need your loving\nGot to have all your loving\nEmpty nights echo your name\n(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)\nWhoa, sometimes I wonder\n(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)\nWill I ever be the same\n(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)\nOh yeah\n\n(Baby, baby,) When you see me smiling, you know\n(I need you and I want you, baby.)\nThings have gotten worse.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)\nAny smile you might see (And I need you and I want you, baby.)\nHas all been rehearsed.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)\nDarling, I can't go on with you.  (And I need you and I want you, baby.)\nThis emptiness won't let me live without you\n(And I need you and I love you, baby.)\nThis loneliness inside me, darling, (And I need you and I want you, baby.)\nMakes me feel half alive.  (And I need you and I...)\n\nBaby, I need your loving\nGot to have all your loving\nBaby, I need your loving\nGot to have all your loving\nBaby, I need your loving\nGot to have all your loving"
