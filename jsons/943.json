    "lyrics": "I Wanna Be Around LyricsI wanna be around, to pick up the pieces -\nWhen somebody breaks your heart -\nSome, Somebody twice as smart as I -\nA somebody who would swear to be true\nAs you used to do with me -\nWho'll leave you to learn\nThat misery loves company -\nWait and see\n\nI mean I wanna be around to see how he does it\nWhen he breaks your heart to bits -\nLet's see if that puzzle really fits, so fine -\nAnd that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet\nAs I sit there applauding from a front row seat -\nWhen somebody breaks your heart just like you\nBroke mine\nWhen somebody breaks your heart just like you\nBroke mine -\nOh yeah\n\nThen...\n\nThat's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet\nAs I sit there applauding from a front row seat -\nSomebody breaks your heart, Yes, Like you broke\nMine -\nWhen somebody breaks your heart like you broke\nMine -\nOh yeahEmbed"
