    "lyrics": "Where the Boys Are LyricsWhere the boys are\nSomeone waits for me\nA smiling face\nA warm embrace\nTwo arms to hold me tenderly\n\nWhere the boys are\nMy true love will be\nHe's walking down some street in town\nAnd I know he's looking there for me\n\nIn the crowd of a million people\nI'll find my valentine\nAnd then I'll climb to the highest steeple\nAnd tell the world he's mine\nTill he holds me\nI'll wait impatiently\nWhere the boys are\nWhere the boys are\nWhere the boys are\nSomeone waits for me\n\nTill he holds me\nI'll wait impatiently\nWhere the boys are\nWhere the boys are\nWhere the boys are\nSomeone waits for me1Embed"
