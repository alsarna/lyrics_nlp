Yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nWith no loving in our souls\nAnd no money in our coats\nYou can't say were satisfied\nBut Angie, I still love you, baby\nEverywhere I look, I see your eyes\nThere ain't a woman that comes close to you\nCome on, baby, dry your eyes\nBut Angie, Angie\nAin't it good to be alive?\nAngie, Angie\nThey can't say we never tried14Embed"
