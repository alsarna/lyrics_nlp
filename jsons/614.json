    "lyrics": "Burning Bridges LyricsFound some letters you wrote me this morning\nThey told of the love we once knew\nNow they're gone I burned them to ashes\nDon't want nothing to remind me of you\n\nBurning bridges behind me\nIt's too late to turn back now\nBurning bridges behind me\nAll I want is to forget you somehow\n\nSold the house we once planned together\nSaid goodbye to the folks we once knew\nThen I moved to a far away city\nTried so hard to forget about you\n\nBurning bridges behind me\nIt's too late to turn back now\nBurning bridges behind me\nAll I want is to forget you somehowEmbed"
