Is there more, is there more? (Is there more?)\nSee, it's a chance we've gotta take\n'Cause I believe that we can make this into\nSomething that will last, last forever, forever\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you ever think when you're all alone\nAll that we can be, where this thing could go?\nAm I crazy or falling in love?\nIs it real or just another crush?\nDo you catch a breath when I look at you?\nAre you holding back like the way you do?\n'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away\nBut I know this crush ain't going away\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nGoing away\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhy do I keep running from the truth? (Why do I keep running?)\nAll I ever think about is you (All I ever think about)\nYou got me hypnotized (Hypnotized)\nSo mesmerized (Mesmerized)\nAnd I just got to know\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you ever think (Ever think) when you're all alone (All alone)\nAll that we can be, where this thing could go? (Go)\nAm I crazy or falling in love? (Crazy)\nIs it real or just another crush? (Another crush, yeah, yeah)\nDo you catch a breath when I look at you?\nAre you holding back like the way I do?\n'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away (Whoa)\nBut I know this crush ain't going away\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (This crush ain't)\nGoing away\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Going away)\nGoing away\n\n[Outro]\n(Do you ever think when you're all alone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAll that we can be, where this thing can go?)\nGoing away (Going away)\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n(Do you catch a breath when I look at you?\nAre you holding back like the way I do?)\n(Oh, going away) Do you ever think when you're all alone\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAll that we can be, where this thing could go?\nGoing away\nDo you catch a breath?7Embed"
