much it cost you should ask pa\nAs far as the watch and chain\nI dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things\nAnd I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know\nThe same size as a boxing ring\nSwimming pool in the front and the back yard\nI ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card\nAnd yea I know that was kind of a low blow\nBut the dough for the So So don't come slow\n[Chorus: Dem Franchize Boyz]\nOh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me\nOh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me\nOh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they

it's only right that I hit you with a--erritt-erritt\nOh, I think they like me when they heard me on the other one\nSo it's only right that I hit you with another one"
