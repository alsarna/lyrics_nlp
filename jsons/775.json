Do you miss me tonight?\nAre you sorry we drifted apart?\nDoes your memory stray to a brighter summer day\nWhen I kissed you and called you sweetheart?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?\nDo you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?\nIs your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?\nTell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?\n\n[Spoken]\nI wonder if you are lonesome tonight\nYou know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part\nFate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart\nAct one was where we met\nI loved you at first glance\nYou read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue\nThen came act two\nYou seemed to change, you acted strange\nAnd why, I've never known\nHoney, you lied when you said you loved me\nAnd I had no cause to doubt you\nBut I'd rather go on hearing your lies\nThan to go on living without you\nNow the stage is bare and I'm standing there\nWith emptiness all around\nAnd if you won't come back to me\nThen they can bring the curtain down\n[Outro]\nIs your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?\nTell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?5Embed"
