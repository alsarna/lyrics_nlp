    "lyrics": "Who Needs You LyricsWho needs you to drive me out of my mind\nWho needs you, I'd like to know\nWho needs you to give me chills when I'm well\nHow fast can a helpless heart go\nI know dear I love you more than a lot\nBut oh what I got to go through\nAnd so dear I guess the answer is simply\nWho needs you, I do\n\nEach time we kiss goodnight\nI find that I get so excited\nI can't sleep all night\nI've lost my appetite\nNo appetite no sleep at night\n\nWho needs you, I'd like to know\nHow fast can a helpless heart go\nI know dear I love you more than a lot\nBut oh what I got to go through\nAnd so dear I guess the answer is simply\nWho needs you, who needs you...I doEmbed"
