Oh please, tell me this\nNow would you die, for the one you loved?\nHold me in your arms, tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nI can be your hero, baby\nI can kiss away the pain\nI will stand by you forever\nYou can take my breath away\n\n[Verse 2]\nWould you swear, that you'll always be mine\nOr would you lie?\nWould you run and hide?\nAm I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?\nI don't care, you're here tonight\n[Chorus]\nI can be your hero, baby\nI can kiss away the pain\nI will stand by you forever\nYou can take my breath away\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, I just wanna hold you\nI just wanna hold you\nOh, yeah\nAm I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?\nWell, I don't care\nYou're here tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nI can be your hero, baby\nI can kiss away the pain (Oh yeah)\nI will stand by you forever\nYou can take my breath away\n\n[Outro]\nI can be your hero\nI can kiss away the pain\nAnd I will stand by you forever\nYou can take my breath away\nYou can take my breath away\nI can be your hero"
