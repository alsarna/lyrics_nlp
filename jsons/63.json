    "lyrics": "See the pyramids along the Nile\nWatch the sun rise on a tropic isle\nJust remember, darling, all the while\nYou belong to me\n\nSee the marketplace in old Algiers\nSend me photographs and souvenirs\nJust remember when a dream appears\nYou belong to me\n\nI'll be so alone without you\nMaybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue\nFly the ocean in a silver plane\nSee the jungle when it's wet with rain\nJust remember till you're home again\nYou belong to me\n\nI'll be so alone without you\nMaybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue\n\nFly the ocean in a silver plane\nWatch the jungle when it's wet with rain\nBut remember darling, till you're home again\nYou belong to me"
