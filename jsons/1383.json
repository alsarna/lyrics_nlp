    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSittin' in the mornin' sun\nI'll be sittin' when the evenin' come\nWatching the ships roll in\nAnd then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sittin' on the dock of the bay\nWatching the tide roll away\nOoo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay\nWastin' time\n\n[Verse 2]\nI left my home in Georgia\nHeaded for the 'Frisco bay\n'Cause I've had nothing to live for\nAnd look like nothin's gonna come my way\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay\nWatching the tide roll away\nOoo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay\nWastin' time\n\n[Bridge]\nLook like nothing's gonna change\nEverything still remains the same\nI can't do what ten people tell me to do\nSo I guess I'll remain the same, yes\n[Verse 3]\nSittin' here resting my bones\nAnd this loneliness won't leave me alone\nIt's two thousand miles I roamed\nJust to make this dock my home\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay\nWatching the tide roll away\nOooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay\nWastin' time\n\n[Outro]\n*Whistling*"
