off with thy liquor,\nDrink upsees out, and a fig for the vicar!\n\nOur vicar he calls it damnation to sip\nThe ripe ruddy dew of a woman's dear lip,\nSays that Beelzebub lurks in her kerchief so sly,\nAnd Apollyon shoots darts from her merry black eye;\nYet whoop, Jack! kiss Gillian the quicker,\nTill she bloom like a rose, and a fig for the vicar!\n\nOur vicar thus preaches,--and why should he not?\nFor the dues of his cure are the placket and pot;\nAnd 'tis right of his office poor laymen to lurch\nWho infringe the domains of our good Mother Church.\nYet whoop, bully-boys! off with your liquor,\nSweet Marjorie 's the word and a fig for the vicar!\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe warder's challenge, heard without,\nStayed in mid-roar the merry shout.\nA soldier to the portal went,--\n'Here is old Bertram, sirs, of Ghent;\nAnd--beat for jubilee the drum!--\nA maid and minstrel with him come.'\nBertram, a Fleming, gray and scarred,\nWas entering now the Court of Guard,\nA harper with him, and, in plaid\nAll muffled close, a mountain maid,\nWho backward shrunk to 'scape the view\nOf the loose scene and boisterous crew.\n'What news?' they roared:--' I only know,\nFrom noon till eve we fought with foe,\nAs wild and as untamable\nAs the rude mountains where they dwell;\nOn both sides store of blood is lost,\nNor much success can either boast.'--\n'But whence thy captives, friend? such spoil\nAs theirs must needs reward thy toil.\nOld cost thou wax, and wars grow sharp;\nThou now hast glee-maiden and harp!\nGet thee an ape, and trudge the land,\nThe leader of a juggler band.'\n\n\nVII.\n\n'No, comrade;--no such fortune mine.\nAfter the fight these sought our line,\nThat aged harper and the girl,\nAnd, having audience of the Earl,\nMar bade I should purvey them steed,\nAnd bring them hitherward with speed.\nForbear your mirth and rude alarm,\nFor none shall do them shame or harm.--\n'Hear ye his boast?' cried John of Brent,\nEver to strife and jangling bent;\n'Shall he strike doe beside our lodge,\nAnd yet the jealous niggard grudge\nTo pay the forester his fee?\nI'll have my share howe'er it be,\nDespite of Moray, Mar, or thee.'\nBertram his forward step withstood;\nAnd, burning in his vengeful mood,\nOld Allan, though unfit for strife,\nLaid hand upon his dagger-knife;\nBut Ellen boldly stepped between,\nAnd dropped at once the tartan screen:--\nSo, from his morning cloud, appears\nThe sun of May through summer tears.\nThe savage soldiery, amazed,\nAs on descended angel gazed;\nEven hardy Brent, abashed and tamed,\nStood half admiring, half ashamed.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nBoldly she spoke: 'Soldiers, attend!\nMy father was the soldier's friend,\nCheered him in camps, in marches led,\nAnd with him in the battle bled.\nNot from the valiant or the strong\nShould exile's daughter suffer wrong.'\nAnswered De Brent, most forward still\nIn every feat or good or ill:\n'I shame me of the part I played;\nAnd thou an outlaw's child, poor maid!\nAn outlaw I by forest laws,\nAnd merry Needwood knows the cause.\nPoor Rose,--if Rose be living now,'--\nHe wiped his iron eye and brow,--\n'Must bear such age, I think, as thou.--\nHear ye, my mates! I go to call\nThe Captain of our watch to hall:\nThere lies my halberd on the floor;\nAnd he that steps my halberd o'er,\nTo do the maid injurious part,\nMy shaft shall quiver in his heart!\nBeware loose speech, or jesting rough;\nYe all know John de Brent. Enough.'\n\n\nIX.\n\nTheir Captain came, a gallant young,--\nOf Tullibardine's house he sprung,--\nNor wore he yet the spurs of knight;\nGay was his mien, his humor light\nAnd, though by courtesy controlled,\nForward his speech, his bearing bold.\nThe high-born maiden ill could brook\nThe scanning of his curious look\nAnd dauntless eye:--and yet, in sooth\nYoung Lewis was a generous youth;\nBut Ellen's lovely face and mien\nIll suited to the garb and scene,\nMight lightly bear construction strange,\nAnd give loose fancy scope to range.\n'Welcome to Stirling towers, fair maid!\nCome ye to seek a champion's aid,\nOn palfrey white, with harper hoar,\nLike errant damosel of yore?\nDoes thy high quest a knight require,\nOr may the venture suit a squire?'\nHer dark eye flashed;--she paused and sighed:--\n'O what have I to do with pride!--\nThrough scenes of sorrow, shame, and strife,\nA suppliant for a father's life,\nI crave an audience of the King.\nBehold, to back my suit, a ring,\nThe royal pledge of grateful claims,\nGiven by the Monarch to Fitz-James.'\n\n\nX.\n\nThe signet-ring young Lewis took\nWith deep respect and altered look,\nAnd said: 'This ring our duties own;\nAnd pardon, if to worth unknown,\nIn semblance mean obscurely veiled,\nLady, in aught my folly failed.\nSoon as the day flings wide his gates,\nThe King shall know what suitor waits.\nPlease you meanwhile in fitting bower\nRepose you till his waking hour.\nFemale attendance shall obey\nYour hest, for service or array.\nPermit I marshal you the way.'\nBut, ere she followed, with the grace\nAnd open bounty of her race,\nShe bade her slender purse be shared\nAmong the soldiers of the guard.\nThe rest with thanks their guerdon took,\nBut Brent, with shy and awkward look,\nOn the reluctant maiden's hold\nForced bluntly back the proffered gold:--\n'Forgive a haughty English heart,\nAnd O, forget its ruder part!\n\nThe vacant purse shall be my share,\nWhich in my barrel-cap I'll bear,\nPerchance, in jeopardy of war,\nWhere gayer crests may keep afar.'\nWith thanks--'twas all she could--the maid\nHis rugged courtesy repaid.\n\n\nXI.\n\nWhen Ellen forth with Lewis went,\nAllan made suit to John of Brent:--\n'My lady safe, O let your grace\nGive me to see my master's face!\nHis minstrel I,--to share his doom\nBound from the cradle to the tomb.\nTenth in descent, since first my sires\nWaked for his noble house their Iyres,\nNor one of all the race was known\nBut prized its weal above their own.\nWith the Chief's birth begins our care;\nOur harp must soothe the infant heir,\nTeach the youth tales of fight, and grace\nHis earliest feat of field or chase;\nIn peace, in war, our rank we keep,\nWe cheer his board, we soothe his sleep,\nNor leave him till we pour our verse--\nA doleful tribute!--o'er his hearse.\nThen let me share his captive lot;\nIt is my right,--deny it not!'\n'Little we reck,' said John of Brent,\n'We Southern men, of long descent;\nNor wot we how a name--a word--\nMakes clansmen vassals to a lord:\nYet kind my noble landlord's part,--\nGod bless the house of Beaudesert!\nAnd, but I loved to drive the deer\nMore than to guide the labouring steer,\nI had not dwelt an outcast here.\nCome, good old Minstrel, follow me;\nThy Lord and Chieftain shalt thou see.'\n\n\nXII.\n\nThen, from a rusted iron hook,\nA bunch of ponderous keys he took,\nLighted a torch, and Allan led\nThrough grated arch and passage dread.\nPortals they passed, where, deep within,\nSpoke prisoner's moan and fetters' din;\nThrough rugged vaults, where, loosely stored,\nLay wheel, and axe, and headsmen's sword,\nAnd many a hideous engine grim,\nFor wrenching joint and crushing limb,\nBy artists formed who deemed it shame\nAnd sin to give their work a name.\nThey halted at a Iow-browed porch,\nAnd Brent to Allan gave the torch,\nWhile bolt and chain he backward rolled,\nAnd made the bar unhasp its hold.\nThey entered:--'twas a prison-room\nOf stern security and gloom,\nYet not a dungeon; for the day\nThrough lofty gratings found its way,\nAnd rude and antique garniture\nDecked the sad walls and oaken floor,\nSuch as the rugged days of old\nDeemed fit for captive noble's hold.\n'Here,' said De Brent, 'thou mayst remain\nTill the Leech visit him again.\nStrict is his charge, the,warders tell,\nTo tend the noble prisoner well.'\nRetiring then the bolt he drew,\nAnd the lock's murmurs growled anew.\nRoused at the sound, from lowly bed\nA captive feebly raised his head.\nThe wondering Minstrel looked, and knew--\nNot his dear lord, but Roderick Dhu!\nFor, come from where Clan-Alpine fought,\nThey, erring, deemed the Chief he sought.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nAs the tall ship, whose lofty prore\nShall never stem the billows more,\nDeserted by her gallant band,\nAmid the breakers lies astrand,--\nSo on his couch lay Roderick Dhu!\nAnd oft his fevered limbs he threw\nIn toss abrupt, as when her sides\nLie rocking in the advancing tides,\nThat shake her frame with ceaseless beat,\nYet cannot heave her from her seat;--\nO, how unlike her course at sea!\nOr his free step on hill and lea!--\nSoon as the Minstrel he could scan,--\n'What of thy lady?--of my clan?--\nMy mother?--Douglas?--tell me all!\nHave they been ruined in my fall?\nAh, yes! or wherefore art thou here?\nYet speak,--speak boldly,--do not fear.'--\nFor Allan, who his mood well knew,\nWas choked with grief and terror too.--\n'Who fought?--who fled?--Old man, be brief;--\nSome might,--for they had lost their Chief.\nWho basely live?--who bravely died?'\n'O, calm thee, Chief!' the Minstrel cried,\n'Ellen is safe!' 'For that thank Heaven!'\n'And hopes are for the Douglas given;--\nThe Lady Margaret, too, is well;\nAnd, for thy clan,--on field or fell,\nHas never harp of minstrel told\nOf combat fought so true and bold.\nThy stately Pine is yet unbent,\nThough many a goodly bough is rent.'\n\n\nXIV.\n\nThe Chieftain reared his form on high,\nAnd fever's fire was in his eye;\nBut ghastly, pale, and livid streaks\nCheckered his swarthy brow and cheeks.\n'Hark, Minstrel! I have heard thee play,\nWith measure bold on festal day,\nIn yon lone isle,--again where ne'er\nShall harper play or warrior hear!--\nThat stirring air that peals on high,\nO'er Dermid's race our victory.--\nStrike it!--and then,--for well thou canst,--\nFree from thy minstrel-spirit glanced,\nFling me the picture of the fight,\nWhen met my clan the Saxon might.\nI'll listen, till my fancy hears\nThe clang of swords' the crash of spears!\nThese grates, these walls, shall vanish then\nFor the fair field of fighting men,\nAnd my free spirit burst away,\nAs if it soared from battle fray.'\nThe trembling Bard with awe obeyed,--\nSlow on the harp his hand he laid;\nBut soon remembrance of the sight\nHe witnessed from the mountain's height,\nWith what old Bertram told at night,\nAwakened the full power of song,\nAnd bore him in career along;--\nAs shallop launched on river's tide,\n'That slow and fearful leaves the side,\nBut, when it feels the middle stream,\nDrives downward swift as lightning's beam.\n\n\nXV.\n\nBattle of Beal' An Duine.\n\n'The Minstrel came once more to view\nThe eastern ridge of Benvenue,\nFor ere he parted he would say\nFarewell to lovely loch Achray\nWhere shall he find, in foreign land,\nSo lone a lake, so sweet a strand!--\nThere is no breeze upon the fern,\nNo ripple on the lake,\nUpon her eyry nods the erne,\nThe deer has sought the brake;\nThe small birds will not sing aloud,\nThe springing trout lies still,\nSo darkly glooms yon thunder-cloud,\nThat swathes, as with a purple shroud,\nBenledi's distant hill.\nIs it the thunder's solemn sound\nThat mutters deep and dread,\nOr echoes from the groaning ground\nThe warrior's measured tread?\nIs it the lightning's quivering glance\nThat on the thicket streams,\nOr do they flash on spear and lance\nThe sun's retiring beams?--\nI see the dagger-crest of Mar,\nI see the Moray's silver star,\nWave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,\nThat up the lake comes winding far!\n\nTo hero boune for battle-strife,\nOr bard of martial lay,\n'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,\nOne glance at their array!\n\n\nXVI.\n\n'Their light-armed archers far and near\nSurveyed the tangled ground,\nTheir centre ranks, with pike and spear,\nA twilight forest frowned,\nTheir barded horsemen in the rear\nThe stern battalia crowned.\nNo cymbal clashed, no clarion rang,\nStill were the pipe and drum;\nSave heavy tread, and armor's clang,\nThe sullen march was dumb.\nThere breathed no wind their crests to shake,\nOr wave their flags abroad;\nScarce the frail aspen seemed to quake\nThat shadowed o'er their road.\nTheir vaward scouts no tidings bring,\nCan rouse no lurking foe,\nNor spy a trace of living thing,\nSave when they stirred the roe;\nThe host moves like a deep-sea wave,\nWhere rise no rocks its pride to brave\nHigh-swelling, dark, and slow.\nThe lake is passed, and now they gain\nA narrow and a broken plain,\nBefore the Trosachs' rugged jaws;\nAnd here the horse and spearmen pause\nWhile, to explore the dangerous glen\nDive through the pass the archer-men.\n\n\nXVII.\n\n'At once there rose so wild a yell\nWithin that dark and narrow dell,\nAs all the fiends from heaven that fell\nHad pealed the banner-cry of hell!\nForth from the pass in tumult driven,\nLike chaff before the wind of heaven,\nThe archery appear:\nFor life! for life! their flight they ply--\nAnd shriek, and shout, and battle-cry,\nAnd plaids and bonnets waving high,\nAnd broadswords flashing to the sky,\nAre maddening in the rear.\nOnward they drive in dreadful race,\nPursuers and pursued;\nBefore that tide of flight and chase,\nHow shall it keep its rooted place,\nThe spearmen's twilight wood?-- \"\n\"Down, down,\" cried Mar, \"your lances down'\nBear back both friend and foe! \"--\nLike reeds before the tempest's frown,\nThat serried grove of lances brown\nAt once lay levelled low;\nAnd closely shouldering side to side,\nThe bristling ranks the onset bide.-- \"\n\"We'll quell the savage mountaineer,\nAs their Tinchel cows the game!\nThey come as fleet as forest deer,\nWe'll drive them back as tame.\"\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n'Bearing before them in their course\nThe relics of the archer force,\nLike wave with crest of sparkling foam,\nRight onward did Clan-Alpine come.\nAbove the tide, each broadsword bright\nWas brandishing like beam of light,\nEach targe was dark below;\nAnd with the ocean's mighty swing,\nWhen heaving to the tempest's wing,\nThey hurled them on the foe.\nI heard the lance's shivering crash,\nAs when the whirlwind rends the ash;\nI heard the broadsword's deadly clang,\nAs if a hundred anvils rang!\nBut Moray wheeled his rearward rank\nOf horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank,--\n\"My banner-man, advance!\nI see,\" he cried, \"their column shake.\nNow, gallants! for your ladies' sake,\nUpon them with the lance!\"--\nThe horsemen dashed among the rout,\nAs deer break through the broom;\n\nTheir steeds are stout, their swords are out,\nThey soon make lightsome room.\nClan-Alpine's best are backward borne--\nWhere, where was Roderick then!\nOne blast upon his bugle-horn\nWere worth a thousand men.\nAnd refluent through the pass of fear\nThe battle's tide was poured;\nVanished the Saxon's struggling spear,\nVanished the mountain-sword.\nAs Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,\nReceives her roaring linn\nAs the dark caverns of the deep\nSuck the wild whirlpool in,\nSo did the deep and darksome pass\nDevour the battle's mingled mass;\nNone linger now upon the plain\nSave those who ne'er shall fight again.\n\n\nXIX.\n\n'Now westward rolls the battle's din,\nThat deep and doubling pass within.--\nMinstrel, away! the work of fate\nIs bearing on; its issue wait,\nWhere the rude Trosachs' dread defile\nOpens on Katrine's lake and isle.\nGray Benvenue I soon repassed,\nLoch Katrine lay beneath me cast.\nThe sun is set;--the clouds are met,\nThe lowering scowl of heaven\nAn inky hue of livid blue\nTo the deep lake has given;\nStrange gusts of wind from mountain glen\nSwept o'er the lake, then sunk again.\nI heeded not the eddying surge,\nMine eye but saw the Trosachs' gorge,\nMine ear but heard that sullen sound,\nWhich like an earthquake shook the ground,\nAnd spoke the stern and desperate strife\nThat parts not but with parting life,\nSeeming, to minstrel ear, to toll\nThe dirge of many a passing soul.\nNearer it comes--the dim-wood glen\nThe martial flood disgorged again,\nBut not in mingled tide;\nThe plaided warriors of the North\nHigh on the mountain thunder forth\nAnd overhang its side,\nWhile by the lake below appears\nThe darkening cloud of Saxon spears.\nAt weary bay each shattered band,\nEying their foemen, sternly stand;\nTheir banners stream like tattered sail,\nThat flings its fragments to the gale,\nAnd broken arms and disarray\nMarked the fell havoc of the day.\n\n\nXX.\n\n'Viewing the mountain's ridge askance,\nThe Saxons stood in sullen trance,\nTill Moray pointed with his lance,\nAnd cried: \"Behold yon isle!--\nSee! none are left to guard its strand\nBut women weak, that wring the hand:\n'Tis there of yore the robber band\nTheir booty wont to pile;--\nMy purse, with bonnet-pieces store,\nTo him will swim a bow-shot o'er,\nAnd loose a shallop from the shore.\nLightly we'll tame the war-wolf then,\nLords of his mate, and brood, and den.\"\nForth from the ranks a spearman sprung,\nOn earth his casque and corselet rung,\nHe plunged him in the wave:--\nAll saw the deed,--the purpose knew,\nAnd to their clamors Benvenue\nA mingled echo gave;\nThe Saxons shout, their mate to cheer,\nThe helpless females scream for fear\nAnd yells for rage the mountaineer.\n'T was then, as by the outcry riven,\nPoured down at once the lowering heaven:\nA whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,\nHer billows reared their snowy crest.\nWell for the swimmer swelled they high,\nTo mar the Highland marksman's eye;\nFor round him showered, mid rain and hail,\nThe vengeful arrows of the Gael.\nIn vain.--He nears the isle--and lo!\nHis hand is on a shallop's bow.\nJust then a flash of lightning came,\nIt tinged the waves and strand with flame;\nI marked Duncraggan's widowed dame,\nBehind an oak I saw her stand,\nA naked dirk gleamed in her hand:--\nIt darkened,--but amid the moan\nOf waves I heard a dying groan;--\nAnother flash!--the spearman floats\nA weltering corse beside the boats,\nAnd the stern matron o'er him stood,\nHer hand and dagger streaming blood.\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\"'Revenge! revenge!\" the Saxons cried,\nThe Gaels' exulting shout replied.\nDespite the elemental rage,\nAgain they hurried to engage;\nBut, ere they closed in desperate fight,\nBloody with spurring came a knight,\nSprung from his horse, and from a crag\nWaved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.\nClarion and trumpet by his side\nRung forth a truce-note high and wide,\nWhile, in the Monarch's name, afar\nA herald's voice forbade the war,\nFor Bothwell's lord and Roderick bold\nWere both, he said, in captive hold.'--\nBut here the lay made sudden stand,\nThe harp escaped the Minstrel's hand!\nOft had he stolen a glance, to spy\nHow Roderick brooked his minstrelsy:\nAt first, the Chieftain, to the chime,\nWith lifted hand kept feeble time;\nThat motion ceased,--yet feeling strong\nVaried his look as changed the song;\nAt length, no more his deafened ear\nThe minstrel melody can hear;\nHis face grows sharp,--his hands are clenched'\nAs if some pang his heart-strings wrenched;\nSet are his teeth, his fading eye\nIs sternly fixed on vacancy;\nThus, motionless and moanless, drew\nHis parting breath stout Roderick Dhu!--\nOld Allan-bane looked on aghast,\nWhile grim and still his spirit passed;\nBut when he saw that life was fled,\nHe poured his wailing o'er the dead.\n\n\nXXII.\n\nLament.\n\n'And art thou cold and lowly laid,\nThy foeman's dread, thy people's aid,\nBreadalbane's boast, Clan-Alpine's shade!\nFor thee shall none a requiem say?--\nFor thee, who loved the minstrel's lay,\nFor thee, of Bothwell's house the stay,\nThe shelter of her exiled line,\nE'en in this prison-house of thine,\nI'll wail for Alpine's honored Pine!\n\n'What groans shall yonder valleys fill!\nWhat shrieks of grief shall rend yon hill!\nWhat tears of burning rage shall thrill,\nWhen mourns thy tribe thy battles done,\nThy fall before the race was won,\nThy sword ungirt ere set of sun!\nThere breathes not clansman of thy line,\nBut would have given his life for thine.\nO, woe for Alpine's honoured Pine!\n\n'Sad was thy lot on mortal stage!--\nThe captive thrush may brook the cage,\nThe prisoned eagle dies for rage.\nBrave spirit, do Dot scorn my strain!\nAnd, when its notes awake again,\nEven she, so long beloved in vain,\nShall with my harp her voice combine,\nAnd mix her woe and tears with mine,\nTo wail Clan-Alpine's honoured Pine.'\n\n\nXXIII.\n\nEllen the while, with bursting heart,\nRemained in lordly bower apart,\nWhere played, with many-coloured gleams,\nThrough storied pane the rising beams.\nIn vain on gilded roof they fall,\nAnd lightened up a tapestried wall,\nAnd for her use a menial train\nA rich collation spread in vain.\nThe banquet proud, the chamber gay,\nScarce drew one curious glance astray;\nOr if she looked, 't was but to say,\nWith better omen dawned the day\nIn that lone isle, where waved on high\nThe dun-deer's hide for canopy;\nWhere oft her noble father shared\nThe simple meal her care prepared,\nWhile Lufra, crouching by her side,\nHer station claimed with jealous pride,\nAnd Douglas, bent on woodland game,\nSpoke of the chase to Malcolm Graeme,\nWhose answer, oft at random made,\nThe wandering of his thoughts betrayed.\nThose who such simple joys have known\nAre taught to prize them when they 're gone.\nBut sudden, see, she lifts her head;\nThe window seeks with cautious tread.\nWhat distant music has the power\nTo win her in this woful hour?\n'T was from a turret that o'erhung\nHer latticed bower, the strain was sung.\n\n\nXXIV.\n\nLay of the Imprisoned Huntsman.\n\n'My hawk is tired of perch and hood,\nMy idle greyhound loathes his food,\nMy horse is weary of his stall,\nAnd I am sick of captive thrall.\nI wish I were as I have been,\nHunting the hart in forest green,\nWith bended bow and bloodhound free,\nFor that's the life is meet for me.\n\nI hate to learn the ebb of time\nFrom yon dull steeple's drowsy chime,\nOr mark it as the sunbeams crawl,\nInch after inch, along the wall.\nThe lark was wont my matins ring,\nThe sable rook my vespers sing;\nThese towers, although a king's they be,\nHave not a hall of joy for me.\n\nNo more at dawning morn I rise,\nAnd sun myself in Ellen's eyes,\nDrive the fleet deer the forest through,\nAnd homeward wend with evening dew;\nA blithesome welcome blithely meet,\nAnd lay my trophies at her feet,\nWhile fled the eve on wing of glee,--\nThat life is lost to love and me!'\n\n\nXXV.\n\nThe heart-sick lay was hardly said,\nThe listener had not turned her head,\nIt trickled still, the starting tear,\nWhen light a footstep struck her ear,\nAnd Snowdoun's graceful Knight was near.\nShe turned the hastier, lest again\nThe prisoner should renew his strain.\n'O welcome, brave Fitz-James!' she said;\n'How may an almost orphan maid\nPay the deep debt--' 'O say not so!\nTo me no gratitude you owe.\nNot mine, alas! the boon to give,\nAnd bid thy noble father live;\nI can but be thy guide, sweet maid,\nWith Scotland's King thy suit to aid.\nNo tyrant he, though ire and pride\nMay lay his better mood aside.\nCome, Ellen, come! 'tis more than time,\nHe holds his court at morning prime.'\nWith heating heart, and bosom wrung,\nAs to a brother's arm she clung.\nGently he dried the falling tear,\nAnd gently whispered hope and cheer;\nHer faltering steps half led, half stayed,\nThrough gallery fair and high arcade,\nTill at his touch its wings of pride\nA portal arch unfolded wide.\n\n\nXXVI.\n\nWithin 't was brilliant all and light,\nA thronging scene of figures bright;\nIt glowed on Ellen's dazzled sight,\nAs when the setting sun has given\nTen thousand hues to summer even,\nAnd from their tissue fancy frames\nAerial knights and fairy dames.\nStill by Fitz-James her footing staid;\nA few faint steps she forward made,\nThen slow her drooping head she raised,\nAnd fearful round the presence gazed;\nFor him she sought who owned this state,\nThe dreaded Prince whose will was fate!--\nShe gazed on many a princely port\nMight well have ruled a royal court;\nOn many a splendid garb she gazed,--\nThen turned bewildered and amazed,\nFor all stood bare; and in the room\nFitz-James alone wore cap and plume.\nTo him each lady's look was lent,\nOn him each courtier's eye was bent;\nMidst furs and silks and jewels sheen,\nHe stood, in simple Lincoln green,\nThe centre of the glittering ring,--\nAnd Snowdoun's Knight is Scotland's King!\n\n\nXXVII.\n\nAs wreath of snow on mountain-breast\nSlides from the rock that gave it rest,\nPoor Ellen glided from her stay,\nAnd at the Monarch's feet she lay;\nNo word her choking voice commands,--\nShe showed the ring,--she clasped her hands.\nO, not a moment could he brook,\nThe generous Prince, that suppliant look!\nGently he raised her,--and, the while,\nChecked with a glance the circle's smile;\nGraceful, but grave, her brow he kissed,\nAnd bade her terrors be dismissed:--\n'Yes, fair; the wandering poor\nFitz-James The fealty of Scotland claims.\nTo him thy woes, thy wishes, bring;\nHe will redeem his signet ring.\nAsk naught for Douglas;--yester even,\nHis Prince and he have much forgiven;\nWrong hath he had from slanderous tongue,\nI, from his rebel kinsmen, wrong.\nWe would not, to the vulgar crowd,\nYield what they craved with clamor loud;\nCalmly we heard and judged his cause,\nOur council aided and our laws.\nI stanched thy father's death-feud stern\nWith stout De Vaux and gray Glencairn;\nAnd Bothwell's Lord henceforth we own\nThe friend and bulwark of our throne.--\nBut, lovely infidel, how now?\nWhat clouds thy misbelieving brow?\nLord James of Douglas, lend thine aid;\nThou must confirm this doubting maid.'\n\n\nXXVIII.\n\nThen forth the noble Douglas sprung,\nAnd on his neck his daughter hung.\nThe Monarch drank, that happy hour,\nThe sweetest, holiest draught of Power,--\nWhen it can say with godlike voice,\nArise, sad Virtue, and rejoice!\nYet would not James the general eye\nOn nature's raptures long should pry;\nHe stepped between--' Nay, Douglas, nay,\nSteal not my proselyte away!\nThe riddle 'tis my right to read,\nThat brought this happy chance to speed.\nYes, Ellen, when disguised I stray\nIn life's more low but happier way,\n'Tis under name which veils my power\nNor falsely veils,--for Stirling's tower\nOf yore the name of Snowdoun claims,\nAnd Normans call me James Fitz-James.\nThus watch I o'er insulted laws,\nThus learn to right the injured cause.'\nThen, in a tone apart and low,--\n'Ah, little traitress! none must know\nWhat idle dream, what lighter thought\nWhat vanity full dearly bought,\nJoined to thine eye's dark witchcraft, drew\nMy spell-bound steps to Benvenue\nIn dangerous hour, and all but gave\nThy Monarch's life to mountain glaive!'\nAloud he spoke: 'Thou still cost hold\nThat little talisman of gold,\nPledge of my faith, Fitz-James's ring,--\nWhat seeks fair Ellen of the King?'\n\n\nXXIX.\n\nFull well the conscious maiden guessed\nHe probed the weakness of her breast;\nBut with that consciousness there came\nA lightening of her fears for Graeme,\nAnd more she deemed the Monarch's ire\nKindled 'gainst him who for her sire\nRebellious broadsword boldly drew;\nAnd, to her generous feeling true,\nShe craved the grace of Roderick Dhu.\n'Forbear thy suit;--the King of kings\nAlone can stay life's parting wings.\nI know his heart, I know his hand,\nHave shared his cheer, and proved his brand;\nMy fairest earldom would I give\nTo bid Clan- Alpine's Chieftain live!--\nHast thou no other boon to crave?\nNo other captive friend to save?'\nBlushing, she turned her from the King,\nAnd to the Douglas gave the ring,\nAs if she wished her sire to speak\nThe suit that stained her glowing cheek.\n'Nay, then, my pledge has lost its force,\nAnd stubborn justice holds her course.\nMalcolm, come forth!'--and, at the word,\nDown kneeled the Graeme to Scotland's Lord.\n'For thee, rash youth, no suppliant sues,\nFrom thee may Vengeance claim her dues,\nWho, nurtured underneath our smile,\nHast paid our care by treacherous wile,\nAnd sought amid thy faithful clan\nA refuge for an outlawed man,\nDishonoring thus thy loyal name.--\nFetters and warder for the Graeme!'\nHis chain of gold the King unstrung,\nThe links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,\nThen gently drew the glittering band,\nAnd laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.\n\nHarp of the North, farewell! The hills grow dark,\nOn purple peaks a deeper shade descending;\nIn twilight copse the glow-worm lights her spark,\nThe deer, half seen, are to the covert wending.\nResume thy wizard elm! the fountain lending,\nAnd the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;\nThy numbers sweet with nature's vespers blending,\nWith distant echo from the fold and lea,\nAnd herd-boy's evening pipe, and hum of housing bee.\n\nYet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel Harp!\nYet, once again, forgive my feeble sway,\nAnd little reck I of the censure sharp\nMay idly cavil at an idle lay.\nMuch have I owed thy strains on life's long way,\nThrough secret woes the world has never known,\nWhen on the weary night dawned wearier day,\nAnd bitterer was the grief devoured alone.--\nThat I o'erlive such woes, Enchantress! is thine own.\n\nHark! as my lingering footsteps slow retire,\nSome Spirit of the Air has waked thy string!\n'Tis now a seraph bold, with touch of fire,\n'Tis now the brush of Fairy's frolic wing.\nReceding now, the dying numbers ring\nFainter and fainter down the rugged dell;\nAnd now the mountain breezes scarcely bring\nA wandering witch-note of the distant spell--\nAnd now, 'tis silent all!--Enchantress, fare thee well!"
