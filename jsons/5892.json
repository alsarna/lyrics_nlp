Mikky Ekko) (Traduction Française) Lyrics[Couplet 1: Rihanna]\nAll along it was a fever\nA cold sweat hot-headed believer\nI threw my hands in the air said show me something\nHe said if you dare come a little closer\nRound and around and around and around we go\nOh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know\n\n[Refrain: Rihanna]\nNot really sure how to feel about it\nSomething in the way you move\nMakes me feel like I can't live without you\nAnd it takes me all the way\nI want you to stay\n\n[Couplet 2: Mikky Ekko]\nIt's not much of a life you're living\nIt's not just something you take it's given\nRound and around and around and around we go\nOh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know\n[Refrain: Mikky Ekko]\n\n[Pont: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]\nThe reason I hold on\nCause I need this hole gone\nFunny you're the broken one\nBut I'm the only one who needed saving\nCause when you never see the light\nIt's hard to know which one of us is caving\n\n[Refrain: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]\nParoles rédigées et traduites par TraduZic\nParoles rédigées et expliquées par la communauté RapGenius France1Embed"
