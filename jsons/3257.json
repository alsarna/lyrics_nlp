    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe Salvation Army band played\nAnd the children drunk lemonade\nAnd the morning lasted all day\nAll day\n\nAnd through an open window came\nLike Sinatra in a younger day\nPushing the town away\nOh\n\n[Chorus]\nAh hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya\nAh hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah\nLife in a northern town\nAh hey ma ma ma ma\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey sat on the stony ground\nAnd he took a cigarette out\nAnd everyone else came down\nTo listen\n\nHe said in winter 1963\nIt felt like the world would freeze\nWith John F. Kennedy\nAnd The Beatles\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAh hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya\nAh hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah\nLife in a northern town\nHey ma ma ma ma\nAh hey ma ma ma\nAh hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah\nAll the work shut down\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe evening turned to rain\nWatched the water roll down the drain\nAs we followed him down\nTo the station\n\nAnd though he never would wave goodbye\nYou could see it written in his eyes\nAs the train rolled out of sight\nBye-bye\n\n[Chorus]\nAh hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya\nAh hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah\nLife in a northern town\nAh hey ma ma ma ma\nAh hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya\nAh hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah\nLife in a northern town\nAh hey ma ma ma ma\nAh hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya\nAh hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah\nAh hey ma ma ma ma\n\nMake it easy on yourself\nSociety's so\nSo hard to desert\nSo hard that you know\nMake it easy on yourself\n\nLife in a northern town\nWe'll get back up\nAh hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya\nAh hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah\n(repeat to fade)"
