Jealous Lover Lyrics(Lover, lover)\n\nHey! jealous lover\nYou're acting so strange\nHey! jealous lover\nWhat is making you change?\n\nHey! jealous lover\nHow wrong can you be?\nI'm yours ever faithful\nJust be faithful to me\n\nI am just as steady as that clock on the shelf\nMaybe you're accusing me of what you're doing yourself\n\nHey! jealous lover\nI'm telling you true\nI know that you're jealous\nBut there's no one but you\nCould have cheated lots of times but just couldn't do\nI was much too busy, baby, being faithful to you\n\nHey! jealous lover\nI'm telling you true\nI know that you're jealous\nBut there's no one but you\n\nThere's no one for me\nJealous lover, but youEmbed"
