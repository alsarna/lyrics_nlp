Tell me where to start\nCause everytime you smile, I feel trembles in my heart\nI have but one concern, how can I get with you?\nTil my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do\n\n[Chorus]\nBe sitting up in my room\nBack here thinking bout you\nI must confess, I'm a mess for you\nBe sitting up in my room\nBack here thinking bout you\nI'm just a mess with a thang for you"
