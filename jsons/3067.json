    "lyrics": "Been running so long\nI've nearly lost all track of time\nIn every direction\nI couldn't see the warning signs\nI must be losin' it\n'Cause my mind plays tricks on me\nIt looked so easy\nBut you know, looks sometimes deceive\n\nBeen running so fast\nRight from the starting line\nNo more connections\nI don't need any more advice\nOne hand's just reaching out\nAnd one's just hangin' on\nIt seems my weaknesses\nJust keep going strong\n\nHead over heels, where should I go?\nCan't stop myself, out of control\nHead over heels, no time to think\nLooks like the whole world's out of sync\n\nBeen running so hard\nWhen what I need is to unwind\nThe voice of reason\nIs one I left so far behind\nI've waited so long\nSo long to play this part\nAnd just remembered\nThat I'd forgotten about my heart\nHead over heels, where should I go?\nCan't stop myself, out of control\nHead over heels, no time to think\nLooks like the whole world's out of sync\n\nHead over heels, where should I go?\nCan't stop myself, out of control\nHead over heels, no time to think\nLooks like the whole world's out of sync\nHead over heels, where should I go?\nCan't stop myself, out of control\nHead over heels, no time to think\nLooks like the whole world's out of sync\nHead over heels, where should I go?\nCan't stop myself, out of control\nHead over heels, no time to think\nLooks like the whole world's out of sync"
