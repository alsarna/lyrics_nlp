    "lyrics": "If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air\nQuaint little villages here and there\nYou're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod\n\nIf you like the taste of a lobster stew\nServed by a window with an ocean view\nYou're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod\n\nWinding roads that seem to beckon you\nMiles of green beneath the skies of blue\nChurch bell chiming on a Sunday morn\nRemind you of the town where you were born\n\nIf you spend an evening you'd want to stay\nWatching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay\nYou're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod"
