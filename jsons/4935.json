Lyrics[Verse 1]\nNo, don't just walk away\nPretending everything's okay\nAnd you don't care about me\nAnd I know it's just no use\nWhen all your lies become your truths\nAnd I don't care\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nCould you look me in the eye\nAnd tell me that you're happy now? (Ooh)\nWould you tell it to my face?\nOr have I been erased?\nAre you happy now?\nAre you happy now?\n[Verse 2]\nYou took all there was to take\nAnd left me with an empty plate\nAnd you don't care about it, yeah\nAnd I am giving up this game\nAnd leaving you with all the blame\n'Cause I don't care\n\n[Chorus]\nCould you look me in the eye\nAnd tell me that you're happy now? (Ooh)\nWould you tell it to my face?\nOr have I been erased?\nAre you happy now? (Ooh)\nAre you happy now?\nAre you happy now?\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nDo you really have everything you want?\nYou can't ever give something you ain't got\nYou can't run away from yourself\nCould you look me in the eye\nAnd tell me that you're happy now? (Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nC'mon, tell it to my face\nOr have I been replaced?\nAre you happy now?\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Are you happy now?)\nOh, oh\n(Are you happy now?) Yeah, yeah, oh, oh\nWould you look me in the eye?\nCould you look me in the eye?\nI've had all that I can take\nI'm not about to break\n'Cause I'm happy now (Ooh)\nAre you happy now?2Embed"
