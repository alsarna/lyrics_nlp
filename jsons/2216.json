    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI have just closed my eyes again\nClimbed aboard the Dream Weaver train\nDriver take away my worries of today\nAnd leave tomorrow behind\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, Dream Weaver\nI believe you can get me through the night\nOoh, Dream Weaver\nI believe we can reach the morning light\n\n[Verse 2]\nFly me high through the starry skies\nOr maybe to an astral plane\nCross the highways of fantasy\nHelp me to forget today's pain\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, Dream Weaver\nI believe you can get me through the night\nOoh, Dream Weaver\nI believe we can reach the morning light\n\n[Verse 3]\nThough the dawn may be coming soon\nThere still may be some time\nFly me away to the bright side of the moon\nAnd meet me on the other side\n[Chorus]\nOoh, Dream Weaver\nI believe you can get me through the night\nOoh, Dream Weaver\nI believe we can reach the morning light\n\n[Outro]\nDream Weaver\nDream Weaver"
