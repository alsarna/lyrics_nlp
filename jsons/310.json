    "lyrics": "You tell me you love me, you say you'll be true\nThen you fly around with somebody new\nBut I'm crazy about you, you butterfly\nYou treat me mean, you're makin' me cry\nI've made up my mind to tell you goodbye\nBut I'm no good without you, you butterfly\nI knew from the first time I kissed you\nThat you were the troublin' kind\n'cause the honey drips from your sweet lips\nOne taste and I'm outta my mind\nI love you so much I know what I'll do\nI'm clippin' your wings, your flyin' is through\n'cause I'm crazy about you, you butterfly\nBrief instrumental interlude-first two lines\nOoh, I'm crazy about you, you butterfly\nBrief instrumental interlude-next two lines\nOoh, I can't live without you, you butterfly\nI knew from the first time I kissed you\nThat you were the troublin' kind\n'cause the honey that drips from your sweet lips\nOne taste and I'm outta my mind\nOoh, I love you so much I know what I'll do\nI'm clippin' your wings, your flyin' is through\n'cause I'm crazy about you, you butterfly\nYou butterfly\nYou butterfly"
