    "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nI've been down one time\nI've been down two times\nBut now I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love\n\nLet me tell ya all about it\nI've been out here so very long, I've lost all my direction\nBaby when you came my way I thought I'd found my protection\nBut a strong wind came into my life, surely took me by surprise\n& I can't seem to control these tears that's falling from my eyes\n\nListen to me\nBaby I depended on you, for a love & affection\nBut now you gone and deserted me, can't you see that I'm in desperation\nI'm in the middle of a bad love storm, ew yeah I just can't let it boy I\nLooked around and all I could see, was water coming over me\n\nAll I do is cry, all I do is walk around and cry\nBut right now I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning in the sea of love\n\nBut that's alright, I don't mind drowning for your love\nThat's alright baby, hear me when I say it's alright\nYou got the kind of love that make me feel alright\nYou got the kind of love baby that make me cry all night long\nYou got the kind of love baby make me do things I don't wanna do\nAnd it's alright"
