Is everything okay?\nI gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, well, my girl's in the next room\nSometimes I wish she was you\nI guess we never really moved on\n\n[Chorus]\nIt’s really good to hear your voice\nSayin' my name, it sounds so sweet\nComin' from the lips of an angel\nHearin' those words, it makes me weak\nAnd I never wanna say goodbye\nBut girl, you make it hard to be faithful\nWith the lips of an angel\n[Verse 2]\nIt‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight\nAnd yes, I've dreamt of you too\nDoes he know you're talkin’ to me\nWill it start a fight?\nNo, I don't think she has a clue\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, well, my girl's in the next room\nSometimes I wish she was you\nI guess we never really moved on\n\n[Chorus]\nIt’s really good to hear your voice\nSayin' my name, it sounds so sweet\nComin' from the lips of an angel\nHearin' those words, it makes me weak\nAnd I never wanna say goodbye\nBut girl, you make it hard to be faithful\nWith the lips of an angel\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's really good to hear your voice\nSayin' my name, it sounds so sweet\nComin' from the lips of an angel\nHearin' those words, it makes me weak\nAnd I never wanna say goodbye\nBut girl, you make it hard to be faithful\nWith the lips of an angel\n(Never wanna say goodbye)\nBut girl, you make it hard to be faithful\nWith the lips of an angel\n[Outro]\nHoney, why you callin’ me so late?31Embed"
