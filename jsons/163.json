    "lyrics": "The tables are empty, the dance floor's deserted\nYou play the same love song - it's the 10th time you've heard it\nThat's the beginning, just one of the clues\nYou've had your first lesson in learnin' the blues\nThe cigarettes you light, one after another\nWon't help you forget her, and the way that you love her\nYou're only burnin' a torch you can't lose\nBut you're on the right track for learnin' the blues\nWhen you're at home alone\nThe blues will taunt you constantly\nWhen you're out in a crowd\nThe blues will haunt your memory\nThe nights when you don't sleep, the whole night you're crying\nBut you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying\nYou'll walk that floor and wear out your shoes\nWhen you feel your heart break, you're learnin' the blues\n\nWhen you're at home alone\nThe blues will taunt you constantly\nWhen you're out in a crowd\nThose blues will haunt your memory\nThe nights when you don't sleep, that whole night you're crying\nBut you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying\nYou'll walk the floor, and you'll wear out your shoes\nWhen you feel your heart break, you're learnin' those blues"
