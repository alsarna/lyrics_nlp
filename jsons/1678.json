    "lyrics": "People see us everywhere\nThey think you really care\nBut myself I can't deceive\nI know it's only make believe\n\nMy one and only prayer\nIs that some day you'll care\nMy hopes, my dreams come true\nMy one and only you\n\nNo one will ever know\nHow much I love you so\nMy only prayer will be\nSomeday you'll care for me\nBut it's only make believe\n\nMy hopes, my dreams come true\nMy life, I'd give for you\nMy heart, a wedding ring\nMy all, my everything\n\nMy heart, I can't control\nYou rule my very soul\nMy plans, my hopes, my schemes\nYou are my every dream\nBut it's only make believe\nMy one and only prayer\nIs that some day you'll care\nMy hopes, my dreams come true\nMy one and only you\n\nNo one will ever know\nJust how much I love you so\nMy only prayer will be\nThat someday you'll care for me\nBut it's only make believe"
