    "lyrics": "Oh very young\nWhat will you leave us this time?\nYou're only dancing on this earth for a short while\nAnd though your dreams may toss and turn you now\nThey will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans\nDenim blue fading up to the sky\n\nAnd though you want them to last forever\nYou know they never will\nYou know they never will\nAnd the patches make the goodbye harder still\n\nOh very young\nWhat will you leave us this time?\nThere'll never be a better chance to change your mind\nAnd if you want this world to see a better day\nWill you carry the words of love with you?\nWill you ride the great white bird into heaven?\n\nAnd though you want to last forever\nYou know you never will\nYou know you never will\nAnd the goodbye makes the journey harder still\n\nWill you carry the words of love with you?\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nOh very young\nWhat will you leave us this time?\nYou're only dancing on this earth for a short while\nOh very young\nWhat will you leave us this time?"
