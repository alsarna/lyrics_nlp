    "lyrics": "A Summer Song LyricsTrees swayin' in the summer breeze\nShowin' off their silver leaves\nAs we walked by\n\nSoft kisses on a summer's day\nLaughing all our cares away\nJust you and I\n\nSweet sleepy warmth of summer nights\nGazing at the distant lights\nIn the starry sky\n\nThey say that all good things must end some day\nAutumn leaves must fall\nBut don't you know that it hurts me so\nTo say goodbye to you\nWish you didn't have to go\nNo no no no\nAnd when the rain\nBeats against my window pane\nI'll think of summer days again\nAnd dream of you\n\nThey say that all good things must end some day\nAutumn leaves must fall\nBut don't you know that it hurts me so\nTo say goodbye to you\nWish you didn't have to go\nNo no no no\n\nAnd when the rain\nBeats against my window pane\nI'll think of summer days again\nAnd dream of you\nAnd dream of you2Embed"
