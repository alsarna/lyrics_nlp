    "lyrics": "For your love\nFor your love\n\nWhen I think about those nights in Montreal\nI get the sweetest thoughts of you and me\nMemories of love above the city lights\nOooh, I've tried so hard to take it\nBut alone my heart won't make it\n\nI just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe\nI just wanna stop\nI never wanna live without you, babe\nI just wanna stop for your love.  Oooh\n\nFor your love\nFor your love.  (For your lo-o-ove.)\n\nWhen I think about the way the world must turn\n(The world must turn)\nI get the saddest thoughts of you and me.  (You and me)\nMemories of life and times go on and on\nOooh, I've tried hard to forget it\nBut alone my mind won't let it\n\nI just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe\nI just wanna stop\nThe world ain't right without you, babe\nI just wanna stop for your love\nOooh, I've tried so hard to take it\nBut alone my heart won't make it\n\nI just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe\nI just wanna stop\nThe world ain't right without you, babe\nI just wanna stop for your love\n\nStop.  Hoo, hoo, hoo\nI just wanna stop.  Hoo, hoo, hoo\nI just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe\nI just wanna stop\nThe world ain't right without you, babe\nI just wanna stop"
