    "lyrics": "I hear singing and there's no one there\nI smell blossoms and the trees are bare\nAll day long I seem to walk on air\nI wonder why, I wonder why ?\n\nI keep tossing in my sleep at night\nAnd what's more I've lost my appetite\nStars that used to twinkle in the skies\nAre twinkling in my eyes\nI wonder why ?\n\nYou don't need analyzin'\nIt is not so surpisin'\nThat you feel very strange but nice!\nYour heart goes pitter patter\nI know just what's the matter\nBecause I've been there once or twice!\n\nPut your head on my shoulder\nYou need someone who's older\nA rub-down with a velvet glove!\nThere is nothing you can take\nTo relieve that pleasant ache\nYou're not sick, you're just in love!\n\nRepeat verse and chorus simultaneously\nNow you know why!\nNow I know why!\nI'm just in love!"
