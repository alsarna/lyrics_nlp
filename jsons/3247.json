Lyrics[Intro]\nOh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, pretty ladies around the world\nGot a weird thing to show you\nSo tell all the boys and girls\nTell yo brother, yo sister\nAnd yo momma too\n'Cause we're about to throw down\nAnd you'll know just what to do\nWave your hands in the air\nLike you don't care\nGlide by the people as they start to look and stare\nDo your dance, do your dance\nDo your dance quick, mama\nCome on baby, tell me, what's the word?\n[Chorus]\nOh, word up!\nEverybody say when you hear their call\nYou've got to get it underway\nWord up! It's the code word\nNo matter where you say it\nYou'll know that you'll be heard\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow all you sucker DJs\nWho think you're fly\nThere's got to be a reason\nAnd we know the reason why\nYou try to put on those airs and act real cool\nBut you've got to realize\nThat you're acting like fools\nGive us music, we can use it\nWe need to dance\nWe don't have the time\nFor psychological romance\nNo romance, no romance\nNo romance for me, mama\nCome on baby, tell me what's the word\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, word up!\nEverybody say when you hear their call\nYou've got to get it underway\n[Interlude/Outro]\nDial \"L\" for low...\nCome on, all you people say...\nW-O-R-D up - W-O-R-D up7Embed"
