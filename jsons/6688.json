You don't even have to try\nYou're cute enough to fuck with me tonight\nLookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white\nBaby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCocaine and drinkin' with your friends\nYou live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend\nI'm not fazed, only here to sin\nIf Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can\n[Chorus]\nCall me when you want, call me when you need\nCall me in the morning, I'll be on the way\nCall me when you want, call me when you need\nCall me out by your name, I'll be on the way like\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nMmm, mmm, mmm\nMmm, mmm, mmm\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyy, ayy\nI wanna sell what you're buyin'\nI wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii\nI want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'\nShoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'\nOh, oh, oh, why me?\nA sign of the times every time that I speak\nA dime and a nine, it was mine every week\nWhat a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me\nNow I can't leave\nAnd now I'm actin' hella elite\nNever want the niggas that's in my league\nI wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCocaine and drinkin' with your friends\nYou live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend\nI'm not fazed, only here to sin\nIf Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can\n[Chorus]\nCall me when you want, call me when you need\nCall me in the morning, I'll be on the way\nCall me when you want, call me when you need\nCall me out by your name, I'll be on the way like\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, call me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)\nTell me you love me in private\nCall me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)\nI do not care if you're lyin'329Embed"
