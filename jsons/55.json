LyricsOh, for just the chance to love you\nWould I love you, love you, love you\nTo take you in my arms\nHas always been my goal\nSure as there's a moon above you\nWould I love you, love you, love you\nWith all my heart and soul\nWith all my heart and soul\n\nYou ask me, would I love you if you let me\nEyes that see are eyes that know\nWould I love you? What a question\nWhen I'm yearning so\n\nOh, for just the chance to love you\nWould I love you, love you, love you\nTo take you in my arms\nHas always been my goal\nSure as there's a moon above you\nWould I love you, love you, love you\nWith all my heart and soul\nWith all my heart and soulEmbed"
