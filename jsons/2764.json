    "lyrics": "There was a time when we were down and out\nThere was a place when we were starting over\nWe let the bound break\nWe let the heartache in\nWho's sorry now?\n\nThere was a world when we were standing still\nAnd for a moment we were separated\nAnd then you found her\nYou let the stranger in\nWho's sorry now?\nWho's sorry now?\n\nWhat, what kind of fool\nTears it apart\nLeaving me pain and sorrow?\nLosing you now\nWonderin' why\nWhere will I be tomorrow?\nForever more that's what we are to be\nWithout each other\nWe'll be remembering when\n\nThere was a time when we were down and out\nWe cried...\nThere was a place when we were starting over\nWe lied...\nWe let the bound break\nWe let the heartache in\nWho's sorry now?\nWho's sorry now?\nWhat, what kind of fool\nTears it apart\nLeaving me pain and sorrow?\nOh, losing you now\nHow can I win?\nWhere will I be tomorrow?\n\nWas there a moment when I cut you down?\nPlayed around?\nWhat have I done?\nI only apologize\nFor being, as they say, the last to know\nIt has to show\nWhen someone is in your eyes\n\nWhat kind of fool\nTears it apart\nLeaving me pain and sorrow?\nLosing you now\nWondering why\nWhere will I be tomorrow?\nWhat, what kind of fool\nTears it apart\nLeaving me pain and sorrow?\nLosing you now\nHow can I win\nWhere will I be tomorrow?"
