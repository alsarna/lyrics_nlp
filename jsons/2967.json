    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, there's a little boy waiting\nAt the counter of the corner shop\nHe's been waiting down there, waiting half the day\nThey never ever see him from the top\nHe gets pushed around, knocked to the ground\nHe gets to his feet and he says\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more than you give\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, there's a pretty girl serving\nAt the counter of the corner shop\nShe's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream\nHer dreams walk in and out; they never stop\nWell she's not too proud, to cry out loud\nShe runs to the street and she screams\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more than you give\nMore than you give\n[Bridge]\nTake a step back and see the little people\nThey might be young\nBut they're the ones that make the big people big\nSo listen as they whisper:\n\"What about me?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd now I'm standing on the corner\nAll the world's gone home\nNobody's changed, nobody's been saved\nAnd I'm feeling cold and alone\nI guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot\nBut sometimes I wish for more, than I've got\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more, you just take more\nYou just take more than you give\n[Outro]\nWhat about me?\nWhat about me?\nWhat about me?"
