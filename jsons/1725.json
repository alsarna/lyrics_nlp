(Look at me)\nWhatcha see (whatcha see) is whatcha get (is whatcha get)\nI mean, what you see (what you see) is what you get now, baby (is what you get)\nAnd the real, real thing is the best thing yet (the best thing yet). Oh!\n\n[Bridge]\n(Whatcha see) (Is whatcha get)\n(I got a real love) (Come and get it)\n(You can have it all)\n(You know)\n\n[Outro]\nWhatcha see, baby, baby (Whatcha see) is whatcha get (Is whatcha get)\nLook at me. Now whatcha see (whatcha see) is whatcha get (Is whatcha get)\nI got to say it now (Baby, baby), whatcha see (Whatcha see) is whatcha get (Is whatcha get)\nEvery day now, whatcha see (Whatcha see) will be whatcha get (Is whatcha get)\nI got to say whatcha see, baby, baby (Whatcha see), is whatcha get (Is whatcha get)\nI got a real love, whatcha see (Whatcha see) will be whatcha get (Is whatcha get)\nLook at me, look at me, look at me, look at me (Whatcha see): It's whatcha get (Is whatcha get)4Embed"
