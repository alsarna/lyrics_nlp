    "lyrics": "I've never wanted wealth untold\nMy life has one design\nA simple little band of gold\nTo prove that you are mine\nDon't want the world to have and hold\nFor fame is not my line\nJust want a little band of gold\nTo prove that you are mine\nSome sail away to Araby and other lands of mystery\nBut all the wonders that they see will never tempt me\nTheir memories will soon grow cold\nBut till the end of time\nThere'll be a little band of gold\nTo prove that you are mine\nI've never wanted wealth untold\nBut till the end of time\nThere'll be a little band of gold\nTo prove that you are mine"
