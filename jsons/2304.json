Here am I\nShould I get in touch with the F.B.I\nI know my call will be accepted\nThere's no chance of bein' disconnected\n\nOn the hot line, hot line\nCalling on the hot line\nFor your love, for your love\nHot line, hot line\nCalling on the hot line\nOn the hot line\n\nDon't keep it busy, don't make me dizzy\nYour love makes me want to shout\nYou're my lover, undercover\nYou know what I'm talkin' about\n\nHot line, hot line\nCalling on the hot line\nFor your love, for your love"
