(I have to give)\nWithout you I don't think I can live\nGive my world to you, baby\nBut love is all I have to give\nThat's all I got to give\n\n[Outro: Howie, Brian & All]\nBut my love is all I have to give\n(Yeah, yeah)\nWithout you I don't think I can live\n(I don't think I can't live)\nI wish I could give my world to you\nBut love is all I have to give (oh-oh, oh!)4Embed"
