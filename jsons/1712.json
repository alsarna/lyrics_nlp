    "lyrics": "Put your hand in the hand\nOf the man who stilled the water\n\nPut your hand in the hand\nOf the man who calmed the sea\nTake a look at yourself and\nA you can look at others differently\n\nBy puttin' your hand in the hand\nOf the man from-a Galilee\n\nEvery time I look into the Holy Book\nI want to tremble\nWhen I read about the part\nWhere a carpenter cleared the temple\nFor the buyers and the sellers were\nNo different fellas than what I profess to be\n\nAnd it causes me shame to know\nI'm not the gal that I should be\n\nPut your hand in the hand\n\nMama taught me how to pray before\nI reached the age of seven\nAnd when I'm down on my knees that's a\nWhen I'm close to heaven\nDaddy lived his life with two kids and a wife\nYou do must you must do\nBut he showed me\nEnough of what it takes to get you through"
