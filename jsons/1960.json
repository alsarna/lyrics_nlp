    "lyrics": "Peaceful LyricsIn the morning fun when no one will be drinking any more wine\nI'll wake the sun up by givin' him a fresh air full of the wind cup\nAnd I won't be found in the shadows hiding sorrow\nAnd I can wait for fate to bring around to me any part of my tomorrow, tomorrow\n\n'cause it's oh, so peaceful here\nThere's no one bending over my shoulder\nNobody breathing in my ear\nOh, so peaceful here\n\nIn the evening shadows are callin' me and the dew settles in my mind\nAnd I think of friends in the yesterday when my plans were giggled in rhyme\nI had a son while on the run and his love brought a tear to my eye\nAnd maybe some day he'll up and say \"We had a pretty nice time\", oh, oh, oh, my\n\n'cause it's oh, so peaceful here\nThere's no one bending over my shoulder\nNobody breathing in my ear\nOh, so peaceful hereEmbed"
