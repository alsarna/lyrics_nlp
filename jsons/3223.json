    "lyrics": "You can look at the menu\nBut you just can't eat\nYou can feel the cushions\nBut you can't have a seat\n\nYou can dip your foot in the pool\nBut you can't have a swim\nYou can feel the punishment\nBut you can't commit the sin\n\nAnd you want her and she wants you\nWe want everyone\nAnd you want her, and she wants you\nNo one, no one, no one ever is to blame\n\nYou can build a mansion\nBut you just can't live in\nYou're the fastest runner\nBut you're not allowed to win\n\nSome break the rules\nAnd let you count the cost\nThe insecurity is the thing that won't get lost\n\nAnd you want her and she wants you\nWe want everyone\nAnd you want her, and she wants you\nNo one, no one, no one ever is to blame\nYou can see the summit\nBut you can't reach it\nIt's the last piece of the puzzle\nBut you just can't make it fit\nDoctor says you're cured\nBut you still feel the pain\nAspirations in the clouds\nBut your hopes go down the drain\n\nAnd you want her and she wants you\nWe want everyone\nAnd you want her, and she wants you\nNo one, no one, no one ever is to blame\nNo one ever is to blame\nNo one ever is to blame"
