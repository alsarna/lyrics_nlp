    "lyrics": "This is the time when you need a friend\nYou just need someone near\nI'm not looking forward to the night\nI'll spend thinking of you when you're not here\n\nHow many times will I think about the things\nI'd like to do?\nAlways denied the right to live my life the way\nI want, I want to share it with you\n\nClose your eyes\nI want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams\n\nI'll think of your kiss as the days roll by\nAnd I'll write the words you love\nBut what I can't say in a letter\nWill just have to wait till I get home\n\nThere's not much time to tell you\nHalf the things that I should\nOnly that I'm so glad I fell in love with you\nAnd I'd do it again if I could\n\nClose your eyes\nI want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams\n\nSleep like a child resting deep\nYou don't know what you give me\nI keep for these moments, whoa, oh oh oh ooh\n\nClose your eyes\nI want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams\n\nClose your eyes\nI want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams\n\nClose your eyes\nI want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams\n\nClose your eyes\nI want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams\nClose your eyes\nI want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams"
