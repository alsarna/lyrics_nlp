The people that you meet\nHello Joe, whatcha know and remind me to mow tell'im business is slow\nBut I'm whistlin' Sam's Song\nEveryone you see\nHas a story to tell or a gimmick to sell, but agrees that it's swell and it's really a grand Song\nSo forget your troubles and wear a smile, you'll find you'll never go wrong\nIf you learn to croon\nLike a lark in the part who is making his mark serenading the dark\nWith the chorus of Sam's Song\n\nIf you learn to croon the happy tune\nThey call it Sam's songEmbed"
