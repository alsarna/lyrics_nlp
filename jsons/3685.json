What the, was that?)\n\nSeemingly lastless, don't mean\nYou can ask us\nPushing down the relative\nBringing out your higher self\nThink of the fine times, pushing\nDown the better few, instead of\nBringing out the clues, to what the\nWorld and everything anger to, brace\nYourself with the grace of ease\nI know this world ain't what it seems\n(What the fuck? Woah man!)\nIt's unbelievable\n[Verse 1]\nYou burden me with your questions\nYou'd have me tell no lies\nYou're always asking what it's all about\nBut don't listen to my replies\nYou say to me I don't talk enough\nBut when I do I'm a fool\nThese times I've spent, I've realized\nI'm going to shoot through\nAnd leave you\n\n[Chorus]\nThe things, you say\nYour purple prose just gives you away\nThe things, you say\nBefore I love you more\nThe things, you say\nYour purple prose just gives you away\nYou're unbelievable\n(What the, was that?)\n\n[Refrain]\nYou're so unbelievable! (what the)\nYou're unbelievable\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Outro]\nIt's unbelievable\n(What the, was that?)\n\nYouâ€™re Unbelievable4Embed"
