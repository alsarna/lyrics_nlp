Boys!\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe wild boys are calling\nOn their way back from the fire\nIn august moon's surrender to\nA dust cloud on the rise\nWild boys fallen far from glory\nReckless and so hungered\nOn the razors edge you trail\nBecause there's murder by the roadside\nIn a sore afraid new world\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey tried to break us\nLooks like they'll try again\n\n[Chorus]\nWild boys never lose it\nWild boys never chose this way\nWild boys never close your eyes\nWild boys always shine\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got sirens for a welcome\nThere's bloodstain for your pain\nAnd your telephone been ringing while\nYou're dancing in the rain\nWild boys wonder where is glory\nWhere is all you angels\nNow the figureheads have fell\nAnd lovers war with arrows over\nSecrets they could tell\n\nPre-Chorus\nThey tried to tame you\nLooks like they'll try again\n\n[Chorus]\nWild boys never lose it\nWild boys never chose this way\nWild boys never close your eyes\nWild boys always shine\n[Refrain]\nWild boys, wild boys, wild boys\nWild boys, wild boys, wild boys\n\n[Chorus]\nWild boys never lose it\nWild boys never chose this way\nWild boys never close your eyes\nWild boys always\n\n[Chorus ]\nWild boys never lose it\nWild boys never chose this way\nWild boys never close your eyes\nWild boys always\n\n[Outro-Chorus ]\nWild boys never lose it\nWild boys never chose this way\nWild boys never close your eyes\nWild boys always, wild boys5Embed"
