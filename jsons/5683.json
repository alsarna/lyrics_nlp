Alien sex\nI'ma disrobe you\nThen I'ma probe you\nSee I abducted you\nSo I tell you what to do\nI tell you what to do, what to do, what to do\n\n[Chorus: Katy Perry]\nKiss me, ki-ki-kiss me\nInfect me with your lovin'\nFill me with your poison\nTake me, ta-ta-take me\nWanna be a victim\nReady for abduction\nBoy, you're an alien\nYour touch, so foreign\nIt's supernatural\nExtraterrestrial\nExtraterrestrial\nExtraterrestrial\n[Outro: Katy Perry]\nBoy, you're an alien\nYour touch, so foreign\nIt's supernatural\nExtraterrestrial"
