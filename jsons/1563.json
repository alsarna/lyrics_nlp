    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThis girl walked in dreams\nPlaying in a world of her own\nThis girl was a child\nExisting in a playground of stone\nThen one night her world was changed\nHer life and dreams were rearranged\nAnd she would never be the same again\n\n[Chorus]\nThis girl is a woman now, and she's learning how to give\nThis girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about\nAnd she's learning, learning to live\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis girl tasted love, as tender as the gentle dawn\nShe cried a single tear, a teardrop that was sweet and warm\nOur hearts told us we were right\nAnd on that sweet and velvet night\nA child had died, a woman had been born\n\n[Chorus]\nThis girl is a woman now, and she's learning how to give\nThis girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about\nAnd she's learning, learning to live\nThis girl is a woman now, she's learning how to give\nThis girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about\nAnd she's learning, learning, learning to live\nThis girl is a woman now, she's learning how to give"
