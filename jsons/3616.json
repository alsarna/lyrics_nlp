    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOutside another yellow moon\nHas punched a hole in the night time mist\nI climb through the window and down to the street\nI'm shining like a new dime\nThe downtown trains are full\nFull of all them Brooklyn girls\nThey try so hard to break out of their little worlds\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou wave your hand and they scatter like crows\nThey have nothing that'll ever capture your heart\nThey're just thorns without the rose\nBe careful of them in the dark\nOh if I was the one you chose to be your only one\nOh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now\n\n[Chorus]\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train\nEvery night, every night its just the same\nOn a downtown train\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know your window and I know its late\nI know your stairs and your doorway\nI walk down your street and past your gate\nI stand by the light of the four way\nAnd watch them as they fall, oh baby\nThey all having their heart attacks\nThey stay at the carnival\nBut they'll never win you back\n[Chorus]\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train\nEvery night, every night its just the same\nYou leave me lonely\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train\nAll my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain\nOn a downtown train\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train\nEvery night, every night its just the same\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train\nAll my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain\nOn a downtown train\nOn a downtown train\nAll my dreams fall like rain\nOn a downtown train"
