(I thank God, I thank God.)\nYou were woman enough, (I thank God, I thank God.)\nGirl, not to try to hide...(Didn't try to hide it, baby.)\nDidn't try to hide your love (Didn't try to hide it, baby.)\nFor this other guy.  Hey.  (Didn't try to hide it, baby.)\nNo need to explain\n\nOhhh, oh, oh.  I thank the angels for you\nThat you were woman enough to try to make it easier for me\nWherever.  (Try to make it easy, try to make it easy, try to make it easy, try to make it easy.)\nSaid wherever you go\nI want you to know you have but to call on me\nAnd I'll be right by your side\n\nOhhh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nThank God for you (I thank God, I thank God.)\nFor it's very nice to see.  (I thank God, I thank God.)\nThere's a man (So understanding, baby.) who understands\n(So understanding, baby.) How hard it is to take your hand\n(So understanding, baby.) And try to explain\n\nOhhh, oh, oh, oh.  Thank the angels for you\nYou're the kind of man you are to be so understanding\nWell...(So understanding, so understanding, so understanding, so understanding.)\nWherever you go, you have but to call on me\nI'm gonna be right by your side.  Yes I will\nOhhh, oh, oh, oh\nThank God above, we were able to see\nJust how wrong we were\nAin't understanding mellow\n(Ain't understanding mellow.  We have this love of ours.)\nAin't understanding mellow\n(Ain't understanding mellow.  We have this love of ours.)\nAin't understanding mellow, baby\n(Ain't understanding mellow.  We have this love of ours.)\n(Ain't understanding mellow.) Oh, when you wake up in the morning, baby\n(Ain't understanding mellow.  We have this love of ours.)\n(Oh, ain't it mellow.) Oh, mellow, baby\n(Ain't understanding mellow.  We have this love of ours.)\n(I just can't do without you.) Oh, I never had a love like this, baby\n(Ain't understanding mellow...)"
