    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nYou look in my eyes\nAnd I get emotional inside\nI know it's crazy but\nYou still can touch my heart\n\nAnd after all this time\nYou'd think that I\nI wouldn't feel the same\nBut time melts into nothing\nAnd nothing's changed\n\n[Chorus:]\nI still believe someday you and me\nWill find ourselves in love again\nI had a dream someday you and me\nWill find ourselves in love again\n\n[Verse 2:]\nEach day of my life\nI'm filled with all the joy I could find\nYou know that I am not the desperate type\n\nIf there's one spark of hope left in my grasp\nI'll hold it with both hands\nIt's worth the risk of burning\nTo have a second chance\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nI need you, baby\nI still believe that we can be together\n\nIf we believe that true love\nNever has to end\nThen we must know that we will love again\n\n[Chorus:]\nI still believe (yeah)\nSomeday you and me will\nFind ourselves in love again\nOh baby, yeah\n\nI had a dream\nSomeday you and me will\nFind ourselves in love again\n\nI still believe\n(Oh, baby, I do)\nSomeday you and me\n(Just give me one more try) in love again\n\nI had a dream\n(I miss your love)\nSomeday you and me will\nFind ourselves in love again\nI still believe\n(Yeah, I still believe)\nSomeday you and me (baby)\nIn love again"
