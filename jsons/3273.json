    "lyrics": "I saw you standing and I felt your rage\nLike a dark cloud on a crowded stage\nYou were talking through the smoke in your fantasy\nI know you girl, I know what to believe\n\nMaybe things ain't been so good at home\nAnd the people that you love never cared at all\nYou want to run away, don't care where you go\nYou want to run away, run away, that's all you know\n\nBelieve it's alright to fantasize\nAnd say the words you think will satisfy me\nBut you know better than that\n'Cause you know what's a lie\n\nYou're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)\nIt's time to wake up, ooh\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)\nIt's time to shape up\n\nIn your dream, it's overcast\nRain comes down, moving your way fast\nYou want to run away, don't care where you go\nYou want to run away, run away, that's all you know\n\nYou turn a corner and you see a door\nWalk on through, throw yourself on the floor\nOh, when you're looking up, it's no surprise\nStanding there is a man with movie star eyes\nYou think he's gonna take care of you\nThe man with the plan that'll see you through\nAnd I say there ain't no way\n'Cause I know he's a lie\n\nYou're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)\nIt's time to wake up, ooh\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)\nIt's time to shape up, shape up\nYou're living on dreamtime (you want to run away)\nWhoa-whoa\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)\nWant to run away, want to run away\n\nI know\nI say\n\nYou're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)\nShape up\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)\nIt's time to wake up\n\nI never saw anybody fall apart so fast\nYou're living in dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last\nNever saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong\nLiving in dreamtime, it's hard to carry on, girl"
