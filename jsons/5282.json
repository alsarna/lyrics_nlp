(Sweet escape)\nIf I could be sweet (Be sweet)\nI know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)\nI didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)\nWe can make it better\nAnd tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?\n(Sweet escape, sweet escape)\n[Refrain: Akon]\n(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo)\nI wanna get away (Get away) to our sweet escape (Sweet escape)\n(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo)\nI wanna get away (Get away), yeah (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]\nYou melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point\nCome help me out, I need to get me out of this joint\nCome on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around\nInstead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground\nSo baby, times get a little crazy\nI've been gettin' a little lazy\nWaitin' on you to come save me\nI can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me\nHopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me\n\n[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]\nIf I could escape (Escape) and recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)\nAnd I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together\nAnd tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)\nIf I could be sweet (Be sweet)\nI know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)\nI didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)\nWe can make it better\nAnd tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?\n(Sweet escape, sweet escape)\n[Bridge: Gwen Stefani & (Akon)]\n(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo)\nIf I could escape\n(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo)\nIf I could escape\n'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor\nIt's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator\nMaybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold\n\n[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]\nIf I could escape (Escape) and recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)\nAnd I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together\nAnd tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
