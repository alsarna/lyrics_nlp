    "lyrics": "(Mother in law)\nMother in law\n(Mother in law)\nMother in law\n\nThe worst person I know\n(Mother in law, mother in law)\n(Mother in law, mother in law)\n\nA she worries me, so\nIf she'd leave us alone\nA we would have a happy home\nSent from down below\n\nMother in law, mother in law\n\nSatan should be her name\nTo me they're bout the same\nEvery time I open my mouth\nShe steps in, tries to put me out\nHow could she stoop so low\n\nI come home with my pay\nShe asks me what I made\nShe thinks her advice is the constitution\nBut if she would leave that would be the solution\nAnd don't come back no more\nMother in law\nMy mother in law, ah\nOh, yeah"
