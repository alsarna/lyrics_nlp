    "lyrics": "Mama died havin' me and papa tried to raise me\nAnd then he took to drinkin' when I was only three\nI'd follow him and his guitar along the streets of Mobile\nWhere he'd sing for just a drink and a lollipop for me\nThen at night he sat me on the bar while he did some singin'\nI played with his old railroad watch when I was a dancin'\nAnd I passed around his worn out hat, they're pitchin' down some quarters\nOh how proud I was to be old Dan Tucker's daughter\nThings seemed to go from bad to worse as I grew sadly older\nAnd papa looked so down and out failin' more each day\nAnd pride I always felt to him slowly turned to pity\nAnd Lord you know it broke my heart each time I hear them say\nGet out away old Dan Tucker\nTake this dime and take this quarter\nGet out away old Dan Tucker\nTake your wine and take your daughter\nPapa died just today a cold gray Mobile mornin'\nNow here I stand all alone cryin' on his grave\nNot a single soul from Mobile came to wish him well his journey\nBut at least for papa's goin', no one there will say\nHey, get out away old Dan Tucker\nTake this dime and take this quarter\nGet out away old Dan Tucker\nTake your wine and take your daughter"
