    "lyrics": "Let Me Be There LyricsWherever you go\nWherever you may wander in your life\nSurely you know\nI always wanna be there\nHolding you hand\nAnd standing by to catch you when you fall\nSeeing you through\nIn everything you do\n\nLet me be there in your morning\nLet me be there in your night\nLet me change whatever's wrong and make it right\nLet me take you through that wonderland\nThat only two can share\nAll I ask you is let me be there\nOh, let me be there\nWatching you grow\nAnd going through the changes in your life\nThat's how I know\nI always wanna be there\nWhenever you feel you need a friend to lean on, here I am\nWhenever you call, you know I'll be there\n\nLet me be there in your morning\nLet me be there in your night\nLet me change whatever's wrong and make it right\nLet me take you through that wonderland\nThat only two can share\nAll I ask you is let me be there1Embed"
