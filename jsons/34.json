    "lyrics": "Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning\nThis need that you and you alone create\nJust fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams\nThe dreams that you inspire with every sweet desire\n\nBe my love and with your kisses set me burning\nOne kiss is all that I need to seal my fate\nAnd, hand-in-hand, we'll find love's promised land\nThere'll be no one but you for me, eternally\nIf you will be my love\n\n(Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning\nThis need that you and you alone create)\nJust fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams\nThe dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire\n\n(Be my love and with your kisses) set me burning\nOne kiss is all that I need to seal my fate\nAnd, hand-in-hand, we'll find love's promised land\nThere'll be no one but you for me, eternally\nIf you will be my love"
