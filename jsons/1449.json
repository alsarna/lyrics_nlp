    "lyrics": "He blesses the boys as they stand in line\nThe smell of gun grease and the bayonets they shine\nHe's there to help them all that he can\nTo make them feel wanted he's a good holy man\nSky pilot...sky pilot\nHow high can you fly\nYou'll never, never, never reach the sky\n\nHe smiles at the young soldiers\nTells them its all right\nHe knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight\nSoon there'll be blood and many will die\nMothers and fathers back home they will cry\nSky pilot...sky pilot\nHow high can you fly\nYou'll never, never, never reach the sky\n\nHe mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile\nThe order is given\nThey move down the line\nBut he's still behind and he'll meditate\nBut it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate\nAs the young men move out into the battle zone\nHe feels good, with God you're never alone\nHe feels tired and he lays on his bed\nHopes the men will find courage in the words that he said\nSky pilot...sky pilot\nHow high can you fly\nYou'll never, never, never reach the sky\nYou're soldiers of God you must understand\nThe fate of your country is in your young hands\nMay God give you strength\nDo your job real well\nIf it all was worth it\nOnly time it will tell\n\nIn the morning they return\nWith tears in their eyes\nThe stench of death drifts up to the skies\nA soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot\nRemembers the words\n\"Thou shalt not kill\"\nSky pilot...sky pilot\nHow high can you fly\nYou never, never, never reach the sky"
