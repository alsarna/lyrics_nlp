T. 109 LyricsIn '43 they put to sea thirteen men and Kennedy\nAboard the PT 109 to fight the brazen enemy\nAnd off the isle of Olasana in the straight beyond Naru\nA Jap destroyer in the night cut the 109 in two\nSmoke and fire upon the sea everywhere they looked was the enemy\nThe heathen gods of old Japan yeah they thought had the best of a mighty good man\n\nAnd on the coast of Kolombangara looking through this telescope\nAustralian Evans saw the battle for the crew had little hope\nTwo were dead and some were wounded all were clinging to the bow\nFightin' fire and flightin' water trying to save themselves somehow\nSmoke and fire upon the sea...\n\nMcMahon the Irishman was burned so badly he couldn't swim\nLeave me here go on he said cause if you don't we'll all be dead\nThe PT skipper couldn't leave him a man to die alone at sea\nAnd with a strap between his teeth he towed the Irishman through the sea\nSmoke and fire upon the sea...\n[ flute ]\nHe led his men through waters dark rocky reefs and hungry sharks\nHe braved the enemy's bayonets a thirty eight hung round his neck\nFour more days and four more nights a rescue boat pulled into sight\nThe PT 109 was gone but Kennedy and his crew lived on\nNow who could guess who could possibly know that same man named Kennedy\nWould be the leader of the nation be the one to take command\nThe PT 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again\nSmoke and fire upon the sea everywhere they looked was the enemy\nBut JFK and his crew lived on\nWhich proves it's hard to get the best of a man named John\n(Big John Big John Big John Big John Big John Big John)Embed"
