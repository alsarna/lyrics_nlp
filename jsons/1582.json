BAR\nBOJACK is sitting at the bar counter.\n\nBARTENDER: Say when.\n\nBOJACK's cup overflows.\n\nBOJACK: When.\n\nA girl sitting in the back of the bar is talking on the phone.\n\nGIRL: Yeah, you'll never guess who's here. Think 90s. No, Bojack Horseman from Horsin' Around. No, I mean he got a little fatter, but it's definitely him. He looks really sad. It's hilarious. (Laughs) Get over here, now!\n\nBojack gets a call from Princess Carolyn.\n\nBOJACK: I told you I don't know where it is. Don't put things in my butt if you want them back.\n\nCut to receptionist desk outside Princess Carolyn's office. Laura, the receptionist, is on the other end of the phone.\n\nLAURA: ...And hold for Princess Carolyn, please?\n\nBOJACK: Thanks, Laura.\n\nA jingle plays over the phone.\nJINGLE: When you're walking alone / Because Jellicles are and Jellicles do / Jellicles do and Jelli--\nCut to Princess Carolyn's office.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: Bojack! It's your favorite agent.\n\nCut to bar.\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, some agent. You couldn't even get me in the room for War Horse. There were, like, ten horses in that movie. I didn't need to be the war horse.\n\nCut to Princess Carolyn's office.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen, dummy, I want to make sure you're all set for your first day with Diane tomorrow.\n\nCut to bar.\n\nBOJACK: Is she gonna ask me a bunch of personal questions?\n\nCut to Princess Carolyn's office.\n\nPRINCESS CAROYLN: The woman we're paying to ghostwrite your memoir? Yeah, probably.\n\nCut to bar.\n\nBOJACK: Okay, alright, there's no need to get--\nCut to Princess Carolyn's office.\n\nPRINCESS CAROYLN: What, catty? Are you gonna say catty?\n\nCut to bar.\n\nBOJACK: I was not gonna say catty.\n\nPRINCESS CAROYLN (V.O.): Oh, what were you gonna say?\n\nBOJACK: I was gonna say catty, because you're a cat.\n\nCut to Princess Carolyn's office.\n\nPRINCESS CAROYLN: Goodbye, BoJack.\n\nCut to bar.\n\nBOJACK: Laura, I know you're listening! You got it, right?\n\nCut to receptionist desk outside Princess Carolyn's office. Princess Carolyn opens the door and pokes her head out. Laura is holding the phone to her ear.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: Laura, do not respond to him. Goodbye, Bojack.\n\nCut to bar. BoJack hangs up the phone.\nBOJACK: She got it.\n\nGIRL and friends are taking pictures of BoJack and laughing. BoJack downs his drink and gets up to leave.\n\nGIRL: Oh my god. Take another one. Take another one!\n\nBoJack stops at the door. Cut to GIRL and friends. BoJack walks up to them.\n\nBOJACK: Excuse me, I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight, and I hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it.\n\nGIRL: Excuse me?\n\nBOJACK: I was actually already in a bad mood, but I thought maybe, for one night, I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself, but now because of you and your friends, I feel more self-conscious than ever.\n\nGIRL: If we were bothering you so much, why didn't you just leave?\n\nBOJACK: Because I didn't think of that, and now I feel stupid!\n\nGIRL: Look, I have a right to be here.\n\nBOJACK: No!\n\nOne of GIRL's friends, an anthropomorphic chicken, lays an egg.\n\nBOJACK: Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty, you're used to getting away with things, but I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others, and I hate you, and you're a horrible person, and you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't make you less of a horrible person.\n\nGIRL: You think I'm pretty?\n\nCut to BOJACK's apartment viewed from the street. BOJACK's car is improperly parked with the passenger door ajar. A trail of clothing leads up to the apartment door.\nINT. BOJACK'S BEDROOM\nBOJACK and GIRL are sitting up in bed. BOJACK is smoking a cigarette.\n\nBOJACK: Well, that was another in a long series of regrettable life choices.\n\nGIRL: What'd you say? I was tweeting about all the weird stuff you do in bed.\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\nCut to BOJACK's apartment from the same street view. It is now day. The scene remains otherwise unchanged.\nINT. BOJACK'S LIVING ROOM\nBOJACK walks through the living room, rubbing his face. GIRL walks up to him carrying a plate of food.\n\nGIRL: Good morning!\n\nBOJACK: Ahh! Why are you here?\n\nGIRL: I Slept here.\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, but why are you still here?\n\nGIRL waves her Toaster Strudel in the air.\n\nGIRL: Breakfast!\n\nBOJACK: That better not be my last Toaster Strudel.\n\nGIRL: No, there were three left.\n\nBOJACK: Well, get out of here. My memoirist is gonna show up soon, and I don't need you-- What's your name?\n\nGIRL: Pam.\n\nBOJACK: I don't need you Pam-ing up the place when she gets here.\n\nPAM bites her toaster strudel. BOJACK walks past her. DIANE spins around in her chair. She is eating a Toaster Strudel.\n\nDIANE: Hey, BoJack.\n\nBOJACK: Ahh! Why are you here?\n\nDIANE: You told me to come at 9:00.\n\nBOJACK: That doesn't sound like me.\n\nDIANE: I have your email right here.\n\nDIANE holds up her smartphone and reads from it.\n\nDIANE: (Clears throat) \"Diane, why don't you come over Tuesday morning at 9:00? Also, you should bring this email with you because I might not remember it because I just took a bunch of horse tranquilizers, ha ha. Also, please don't put in my book that I use horse tranquilizers, ha ha. I just use a small dose to help me fall asleep at night and then a much, much larger dose to get me through the day. Also, I'm drunk. Also, I'm alone, so alone, so, so alone. Please don't put that in my book, book, book, book 'em, dildo. Does it taste like magenta in here?\" Then I think you fell asleep on the keyboard, because it just says the letter \"B\" 27 times.\n\nBOJACK: That does sound like me.\n\nPAM walks up behind BOJACK. DIANE stands up from her chair. BOJACK ushers her away from DIANE.\n\nBOJACK: Well, anyway, this is my businessperson...\n\nPAM: Excuse me?\n\nBOJACK: ...here to help me with some business needs. All very above board.\n\nPAM: Uh, what'd you say?\n\nBOJACK: No need to mention her in the book either, unless it's a business book. (Laughs)\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER comes out from behind the fridge door and closes it.\n\nMR. PEANBUTBUTTER: Ha ha, classic BoJack!\n\nBOJACK: Why are you here?\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, funny story! I'm filming a reality show later, so I thought I'd drop by with the old tennis ball and chain.\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER wraps his arm around DIANE.\n\nBOJACK: That is neither funny nor a story nor a reason for you to drop by.\n\nDIANE scratches MR. PEANUTBUTTER behind the ear. MR. PEANUTBUTTER pants.\n\nDIANE: Aw, he just wanted to come over and brag about his reality show.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Get this, I am starring in a pilot presentation for a celebrity reality show. It's pretty cutting edge, huh?\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, if it's 2003.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ha ha, don't tell VH1 that! Seriously, though, please don't tell VH1 that. We are calling it Peanutbutter and Jelly. Get it? Because I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.\n\nBOJACK: Okay, who's Jelly?\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, no, no, it's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It's wordplay.\n\nBOJACK: You may have too forgiving a definition of the word \"wordplay.\"\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, it's a working title.\n\nBOJACK: Well, it could be working harder, and that's wordplay. How'd you even get in here?\n\nDIANE: Your roommate let us in.\n\nTODD's hand shoots up into the frame, holding a Toaster Strudel.\n\nTODD (O.S.): Mi casa es su casa.\n\nCut to side view of the group.\n\nBOJACK: And that is the last of the Toaster Strudels, and now my morning is ruined.\n\nTODD: Could you guys keep it down, okay? I'm kind of on a date right now.\n\nCut to a close-up of TODD, laying on the couch. He is wearing a suit, but no pants.\n\nTODD: (Speaking Japanese) In America, I am actually considered very handsome.\n\nCut to close-up of TODD's computer screen. A Japanese girl is video chatting with him. She laughs. Cut to full view of the group.\n\nBOJACK: Okay, I'm gonna go get breakfast, and when I get back, I want everyone out of my house except for you and...\n\nBOJACK points at TODD.\n\nBOJACK: ...you and--\n\nBOJACK points at DIANE, then turns to PAM and points at her.\n\nBOJACK: Who are you again?\n\nPAM: The girl you had sex with.\n\nBOJACK: Right. You definitely should have already been gone.\n\nCut to the parking lot of J'Von's Supermarket. BOJACK swerves into a space in the parking lot. The tires screech.\nINT. J'VON'S SUPERMARKET\nTwo anthropomorphic canine women are talking.\n\nPOODLE WOMAN: I really shouldn't eat chocolate 'cause it can literally kill me.\n\nCORGI WOMAN: Oh, I know.\n\nPOODLE WOMAN: But I love chocolate.\n\nCORGI WOMAN: Story of my life.\n\nThe women laugh. BOJACK walks by behind the women. He is holding a grocery basket. Cut to close-up on BOJACK as he browses produce. He finds a box of \"Muffin Man Apple Muffins.\"\n\nSEAL MAN (O.S.): Hey, excuse me.\n\nCut to full view of BOJACK and SEAL MAN. SEAL MAN is standing behind BOJACK.\n\nBOJACK: Yes, I am BoJack Horseman, star of Horsin' Around.\n\nSEAL MAN: Yeah, okay, I don't care. Those are my muffins.\n\nBOJACK turns to face SEAL MAN.\n\nBOJACK: I'm sorry, I-- I don't understand. Did you bring them into the store with you?\n\nSEAL MAN: No, but I was going to buy them. That's the last box and I had dibs on them.\n\nBOJACK: Really? You had dibs?\n\nSEAL MAN: Yeah, dibs. I just put them down for a second while I went to the bathroom.\n\nBOJACK:  Look, I don't even want the muffins. I was just looking at them, but I got to say, if you put muffins down, they're not your muffins.\n\nSEAL MAN: So what, I was supposed to take the muffins into the bathroom with me?\n\nBOJACK: You didn't even put the muffins in a cart. You just left them out here.\n\nSEAL MAN: Yeah, in the produce section. Clearly, muffins aren't supposed to be in the produce section. That wasn't a sign to you that maybe someone else had dibs?\n\nBOJACK: Look, I don't want to get into a whole thing here.\n\nSEAL MAN: Then give me the muffins.\n\nBOJACK: No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.\n\nBOJACK tosses the muffins into his grocery basket.\n\nSEAL MAN: You think that because you're a pseudo-celebrity, normal rules don't apply to you?\n\nBOJACK: Pseudo?! Would you say that to Eric McCormack? Look, I've had a rough morning, so I don't need--\n\nCut to a closeup of SEAL MAN. He turns away briefly while speaking.\n\nSEAL MAN: You've had a rough morning? I spent the last ten months--\n\nSEAL MAN turns back to look at BOJACK. Cut to a wide view of the scene. BOJACK has left. OTTER MAN calls after BOJACK.\n\nSEAL MAN: Hey!\n\nCut to the cash registers. BOJACK finishes paying the cashier for the muffins. BOJACK calls back to SEAL MAN.\n\nBOJACK: Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya!\n\nCut to an extreme closeup of SEAL MAN.\n\nSEAL MAN: You're going to regret this, BoJack Horseman.\n\nCut to a closeup on BOJACK, facing the exit with plastic bag in hand.\n\nBOJACK: Oh really? I'm gonna regret buying muffins?\n\nBOJACK takes the muffins out of the plastic bag.\n\nBOJACK: What, have they got a lot of saturated fat in them?\n\nBOJACK flips over the box of muffins and reads the back label.\n\nBOJACK: Oh, man, they do have a lot of saturated fat.\n\nCut to a wide view of BOJACK and the cash registers.\n\nBOJACK: Why'd I buy these?\n\nCut to a cliffside view of BOJACK's apartment and the town below.\nINT. BOJACK'S KITCHEN\nDIANE and TODD are sitting at the kitchen table. DIANE is using a laptop. TODD is staring at the ceiling, smiling. BOJACK is lying on the floor with his hand in the box of muffins.\n\nBOJACK: Man, I really regret buying those muffins and then eating them all on the drive home.\n\nTODD: Well, my date with Ayako went really well. Thanks for asking.\n\nBOJACK raises his head and points at TODD with his muffin-box hand.\n\nBOJACK: I specifically didn't ask, and I'll thank you to respect my total lack of interest in your personal life.\n\nCut to a closeup of TODD and DIANE.\n\nTODD: She's hilarious. I never met a girl who was so curious about American bank routing numbers.\nBOJACK enters the frame, sitting at the table next to DIANE.\n\nBOJACK: Still not interested.\n\nDIANE: Should we get started on the book?\n\nBOJACK: What's your hurry?\n\nTODD: What do you guys think I should get Ayako for our 12-hour anniversary? She wants a framed picture of my mother's maiden name.\nBOJACK stands up.\n\nBOJACK: Okay, let's get to work.\n\nCut to a distant street view of BOJACK's apartment. Outside the gate, an anthropomorphic sheep man is trimming the hedges with shears. He pauses to take a bite of the hedge.\n\nDIANE (V.O.): Let's start at the beginning.\n\nINT. BOJACK'S OFFICE\nBOJACK is sitting behind his desk, drinking an alcoholic beverage. DIANE is sitting on the other side of the desk with her laptop.\n\nDIANE: What was your childhood like?\n\nBOJACK: Normal.\n\nDIANE: Normal?\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, it was, uh, normal-- normal childhood stuff.\n\nCut to a flashback of BOJACK's childhood home. BOJACK'S DAD is sitting at the kitchen table reading a newspaper. BOJACK'S MOM walks up to him carrying a plate with an omelet on it. She is smoking a cigarette.\n\nBOJACK'S MOM: Here's your omelet.\n\nBOJACK's DAD looks up from his paper. BOJACK'S MOM throws the plate onto the table. The omelet falls halfway off the plate.\n\nBOJACK'S MOM: I'm sorry it's not as good as the omelets your secretary makes, but then you're not married to your secretary, are you?\n\nBOJACK'S DAD: Well, maybe if my secretary also refused to get an abortion, I would be.\n\nPan out to reveal KID BOJACK is also sitting at the table.\n\nKID BOJACK: Mommy, can I have an omelet?\n\nBOJACK'S MOM: You're the birthday boy.\n\nCut back to BOJACK's office. BOJACK downs the rest of his drink and wipes his mouth.\n\nBOJACK: Normal childhood, and then just get right into the big, famous part.\n\nDIANE: Look, if you're not ready to talk, we can wait.\n\nBOJACK: (Talking over her) I am ready to talk!\n\nBOJACK stands up and paces.\n\nBOJACK: Why wouldn't I want to talk about my parents? They're so normal. That's crazy.\n\nBOJACK points at DIANE.\n\nBOJACK: You sound like a crazy person, not me. Stop being so crazy, crazy. (Laughing) Why are you calling me crazy?\n\nBOJACK sits back down in his chair.\n\nDIANE: Okay. Was your father--\n\nBOJACK's phone rings.\n\nBOJACK: Hold on, I got to take this. Hello?\n\nLAURA (V.O.): Hey, BoJack, I've got Princess Carolyn for you. It's urgent.\n\nBOJACK: Great, put her on.\n\nLAURA (V.O.): Just a sec. I'll see if she's available.\n\nA jingle plays over the phone.\n\nJINGLE: When you're walking alone / Because Jellicles are and Je--\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN (V.O.): BoJack...\n\nCut to PRINCESS CAROLYN running on a treadmill at a gym.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: ...are you watching MSNBSea right now?\n\nCut to BOJACK in his office.\n\nBOJACK: Great question. Well, I didn't fall down on my remote, randomly changing the channel to MSNBSea while simultaneously crippling myself...\n\nCut to PRINCESS CAROLYN running on a treadmill at a gym. She appears unamused.\n\nBOJACK: ...thus physically forcing me to watch MSNBSea...\n\nCut to BOJACK in his office.\n\nBOJACK: ...so no. No, I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.\n\nCut to a wide view of PRINCESS CAROLYN running on a treadmill at a gym. She is flanked by two anthropomorphic runners, one a cheetah and one a sloth who is dangling from the machine. A human woman is standing in the background with a water bottle.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, well, Hamlet, you might want to turn it on. They're talking about you.\n\nCut to BOJACK in his office.\n\nBOJACK: Ooh! Good things, I hope.\n\nBOJACK stands up and runs off-screen. Cut to DIANE sitting her chair. She sighs and closes her laptop. Cut to a closeup of the television screen broadcasting MSNBSea. Anthropomorphic whale news anchor TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO is addressing the public.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal, a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.\n\nThe television screen splits to reveal a video feed of NEAL MCBEAL, the SEAL MAN from the supermarket, dressed in uniform.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Welcome to the program, Neal.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Thank you, Tom.\n\nCut to BOJACK, TODD, and DIANE watching the TV screen in BOJACK's living room. TODD is sitting on the couch. BOJACK is standing behind him. DIANE is standing off to the side. BOJACK points to the TV.\n\nBOJACK: Hey, I met this guy.\n\nCut to a closeup of the TV screen.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: All Neal wanted when he got home-- and I emphasize, from Afghanistan-- was his favorite brand of breakfast muffins. When he went to the supermarket and called dibs on the last box-- Well, tell us what happened, Neal.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Bojack Horseman, from the 90s sitcom Horsin' Around, refused to respect my dibs.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman?\n\nThe TV screen switches to display a photo of BOJACK at a Christmas party. In the photo, two women are standing to his left and a third woman is standing to his right. A man dressed as Santa Clause is standing on the far right. BOJACK is sneezing all over the woman to his right.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.\n\nCut to BOJACK and DIANE in the living room.\n\nBOJACK: (Distraught) Oh, not the sneezing pic-- Why do they always use the sneezing picture?\n\nCut to the TV screen. The display has returned to a portrait view of TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: In the 90s, we laughed at your antics. Oh, how we laughed. \"Ha ha ha,\" we chortled in rapturous glee. But when you deny the dibs called by our men and women on the front lines, that is a sick joke, sir.\n\nCut to a closeup of BOJACK. He shakes his head.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: A sick, sick joke, indeed...\n\nCut back to the TV screen.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: ...and you'll forgive me if I chortle no longer, for, to me, there is nothing the least bit funny about stealing a meal from Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO grunts and fires water out of his blow hole. Cut to BOJACK, DIANE, and TODD in the living room.\n\nTODD: Wait, wait, you stole muffins from a Navy SEAL?\n\nBOJACK: I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL. I just thought he was a regular kind of seal.\n\nCut back to the TV screen. The display has returned to a split view of TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO and NEAL MCBEAL.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: This is classic Hollywood elitism. Bojack Horseman thinks that because he was on TV, that makes him better than everybody. Well, guess what, Bojack...\n\nCut back to the group in the living room.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: ...now I'm on TV...\n\nBOJACK shakes his head. Cut back to the TV screen. NEAL MCBEAL raises his arms.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: ...so now I'm better than everybody!\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO repeatedly pokes his finger into the desktop in front of him for emphasis.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: That's right, Neal.\n\nCut back to the group in the living room.\n\nBOJACK: You didn't even have dibs, you stupid sea cow. (To DIANE and TODD.) You guys think I should call in and set the record straight?\n\nCut to a closeup on DIANE.\n\nDIANE: BoJack, these people feed off controversy. If you dignify the story with a response, it's just gonna fan--\n\nCut to the TV screen. The display has returned to a portrait view of TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO. He is holding two fingers to his ear.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: I'm now receiving word that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.\n\nCut to BOJACK and DIANE in the living room. BOJACK takes his cell phone away from his ear and puts his hand over the receiver.\n\nBOJACK: (To DIANE) Sorry, I stopped listening. You were leading up to a \"yes,\" right?\n\nCut back to the TV screen. The display has returned to a split view of TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO and NEAL MCBEAL.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: BoJack, what you did today was a slap in the face of America's heroes. Will you apologize?\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO and NEAL MCBEAL cross their arms simultaneously.\nCut back to BOJACK, DIANE, and TODD in the living room.\n\nBOJACK: Okay, enough about America's heroes. Can we talka bout dibs? Because he didn't even really have dibs. If he had legitimate dibs--\n\nCut to a closeup of NEAL MCBEAL.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Oh, I had dibs on the muffins. I hid them in the produce section!\n\nCut back to the group in the living room.\n\nBOJACK: You left them totally out in the open. That's hiding? How did you survive in Afghanistan?!\n\nCut to a closeup of NEAL MCBEAL.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins! (Barks)\n\nCut to a closeup of BOJACK.\n\nBOJACK: Hey, guess what, I can't give them back 'cause I ate them all, okay?\n\nCut to a closeup of TODD with spoon in hand.\n\nTODD: (Disapprovingly) Dude.\n\nCut back to the TV screen.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Hold on, just to be clear, since this morning, you ate all the muffins?\n\nCut to an extreme closeup of BOJACK.\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting because I have no self-control and I hate myself.\n\nPan out to BOJACK and DIANE. DIANE finishes writing on a notepad and turns it towards BOJACK, revealing the words, \"STOP TALKING!!\"\n\nBOJACK: Is that what you want to hear?\n\nCut to an extreme closeup of TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Neil, was it a small container of muffins, like two to four muffins?\n\nCut to a closeup of NEAL MCBEAL.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: No, Tom, there were a good deal more than that.\n\nCut back to an extreme closeup of TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Can you remember exactly how many muffins were in the box?\n\nCut to BOJACK, falling to his knees in front of the TV screen.\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, there were exactly 12! I ate 12 muffins, and I didn't even want one! There's your goddamn news story, the myster of my missing goddamn self-respect! (Pants)\n\nCut to a side view of the living room. BOJACK picks up the remote and turns off the TV.\n\nBOJACK: (Panting) How'd I come off?\n\nDIANE scratches her head.\n\nTODD: Well, that went slightly better than the worst it could have possibly gone, so...hooray?\n\nCut to a closeup of a horse-shaped inner tube floating in BOJACK's swimming pool. An open beer bottle is resting in one of the cup holders.\nINT. BOJACK'S OFFICE\nBOJACK is pouring himself another drink. DIANE is sitting across the room on a couch.\n\nBOJACK: It's not even about the muffins. Everyone is just out to get me because I'm famous and so well-adjusted.\n\nDIANE: Well, at least you've got some privacy. My boyfriend's filming a reality show at our house. If I want to be alone, I have to go to the roof because it's the only place they don't have insurance to film.\n\nBOJACK walks up to DIANE.\n\nBOJACK: You go on the roof?\n\nDIANE: Yeah, just to get some work done. Is that really weird?\n\nBOJACK sits down on the couch next to DIANE.\n\nBOJACK: No, it's adorable.\n\nDIANE: When I was a kid, I used to climb up on the roof with my dad and look at the stars. What about you?\n\nDIANE holds up a voice recorder.\n\nDIANE: Were you close with your father?\n\nCut to a flashback of KID BOJACK and BOJACK'S DAD. They are in the study. BOJACK'S DAD is prodding a ship in a bottle with a stick. He is smoking a pipe. KID BOJACK holds up a heart-shaped paper card with the word, \"Daddy,\" written on it.\n\nKID BOJACK: Happy Father's Day, Daddy.\n\nBOJACK'S DAD takes the card and opens it vertically.\n\nBOJACK'S DAD: What's this supposed to be, a lima bean?\n\nKID BOJACK: It's a heart.\n\nBOJACK'S DAD: That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.\n\nKID BOJACK: I tried my best.\n\nBOJACK'S DAD: No, you didn't. You slacked off and took the easy way out. In this world, you can either do things the easy way or the right way. You take a boat from here to New York, you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman or cut through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat?\n\nKID BOJACK: Um, the canal?\n\nBOJACK'S DAD stands up and slaps KID BOJACK. KID BOJACK tears up.\n\nBOJACK'S DAD: You go around the horn the way God intended!\n\nCut back to BOJACK and DIANE on the couch.\n\nBOJACK: Uneventful.\n\nDIANE: What?\n\nBOJACK: What?\n\nDIANE: I asked if you were close with your father, and you sat here in silence for five minutes and then said, \"Uneventful.\"\n\nBOJACK: You know what, this is a really good conversation, and I definitely want to keep having it...\n\nBOJACK stands up.\n\nBOJACK: ...but I just keep thinking about the muffins thing, so maybe we could put a pin in this thorough deconstruction of my past so I can put that other thing to be before it spirals out of con--\n\nCut back to the TV screen. It is cut into thirds, with NEAL MCBEAL on the left, TOM JUMBO-GRUMBO in the middle, and BOJACK on the right.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: I had dibs! My dibs were on those muffins!\n\nBOJACK: Your dibs were void!\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: I spent a year in Afghanistan making America safer, and this is the thanks I get?\n\nBOJACK: Really, you, specifically, made America safer?\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Well, Bojack, surely even you would agree that the troops are heroes.\n\nBOJACK: I don't agree to that. Maybe some of the troops are heroes but not automatically. I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks. Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.\n\nPan out to a wider view of BOJACK's office. DIANE, TODD, and a camera man are standing in front of BOJACK. DIANE facepalms.\n\nBOJACK: What?\n\nCut back to the TV screen.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Did you just say you think the troops are jerks?\n\nBOJACK: Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you?\n\nEXT. BOJACK'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY\nTwo news vans are parked outside of BOJACK's front gate.\nCUT TO: BOJACK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM\nBOJACK is watching the previous news broadcasting of himself on television. He is reclining in a chair with pajamas on.\n\nBOJACK: No, no, no.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO (recording): The troops are jerks?\n\nBOJACK: Oh, God.\n\nBOJACK's phone rings. He answers it.\n\nBOJACK: Hello?\n\nLAURA (V.O.): Princess Carolyn needs to talk to you immediately.\n\nBOJACK: Great, put her on.\n\nLAURA: She's actually just getting out of a meeting. Can you hold for a sec?\n\nBOJACK: You called me.\n\nA jingle plays over the phone.\n\nJINGLE: When you're walking alone / Because Jellicles are / And Jellicles do\n\nBOJACK: Ugh.\n\nCut to black. The words \"LIKE AN HOUR LATER\" appear on the screen. Cut back to BOJACK in his chair. The jingle is still playing.\n\nJINGLE: Jellicles would / And Jellicles can\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack.\n\nBOJACK: Ah!\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm gonna level with you, honey. This whole you hating the troops thing is not great.\n\nBOJACK: I don't hate the troops! I just hate one specific troop. I don't even hate him, really.\n\nNews helicopters are flying in the air outside BOJACK's house.  BOJACK walks to the window and looks out at them.\n\nBOJACK: I just think that he's wrong about the muffins.\n\nBOJACK draws the shades.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: I know, BoJack -- just like always, you're right, and everyone else is wrong. But if you don't swallow your pride, this is never gonna let up. I know you're stubborn --\n\nBOJACK: I'm not stubborn. I'm proud.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: That's kind of the same thing.\n\nBOJACK: No, it's an important distinction.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, fine. You're not stubborn. But I'm about to tell you something very important, so I want you to listen carefully. I'm getting another call. I'm gonna have to put you on hold.\n\nA jingle plays over the phone.\n\nJINGLE: When you're walking alone\n\nBOJACK sits down in his chair.\n\nJINGLE: Because Jellicles are / And Jellicles do\nCUT TO: TV BROADCAST\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: It is now day three of the great BoJack jerk-off -- Really? That's the name we came up with for this? Who came up with that? Was it Randy? Did Randy come up with that?\n\nThe broadcast splits in two. The second half shows an aerial view of BOJACK's house. Protesters are standing outside the front gate.\n\nTOM JUMBO-GRUMBO: Anyway, the former television actor who hates our troops has not left his home since his controversial remarks on Monday about how he hates the troops.\n\nCut to an interview segment with an anthropomorphic bear holding a sign that reads: \"BOJACK'S VIEWS ARE UNBEARABLE.\" The text superimposed at the bottom of the screen reads: \"HAS-BEEN HATES TROOPS, LOOKS FAT.\"\n\nBEAR PROTESTER: BoJack Horseman makes me sick. He voiced his opinion, even though it was unpopular, and that's the most cowardly thing a person can do.\n\nCut to an interview segment with PAM. The broadcast text below her reads: \"SOME GIRL WHO SLEPT WITH BOJACK HORSEMAN.\"\n\nPAM: After we made love, he covered himself in sheets like an Arab.\n\nCut to the white house. JOAN KAPUR, the Capitol Hill Correspondent, is speaking to the camera.\n\nJOAN KAPUR: At this very moment, Congress is voting on a major education bill that could completely restructure the --\n\nTOM JUMBO-WUMBO cuts JOAN KAPUR off. The screen splits in half, inserting him on the left side.\n\nTOM JUMBO-WUMBO: Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we've got some big news on the BoJack Horseman front.\n\nCut to an aerial view of BOJACK's house.\n\nTOM JUMBO-WUMBO (V.O.): It appears that BoJack's Lexus is coming out of the garage. This is very big news, indeed.\n\nCut to the Lexus. TODD is driving with DIANE in the passenger seat. The back seat is filled with dirty laundry. Reporters approach TODD and he rolls down the window.\n\nREPORTER: Any comment on BoJack's controversial remarks this week?\n\nTODD: Uh, nope.\n\nTODD guns it and the tires screech on the pavement. Cut to the inside of the car. BOJACK pops out from beneath the pile of laundry.\n\nBOJACK: So where are we going?\n\nTODD: Don't worry, I've got a plan.\n\nTODD lets go of the wheel to dial a number on his phone. DIANE takes hold of the wheel, steadying the car.\n\nDIANE: Whoa! Jeez.\n\nTODD takes hold of the wheel as he puts the phone to his ear.\n\nTODD: Ayako, hey, I need you to get me three tickets to Kyoto.\n\nAYAKO (V.O., speaking Japanese): You son of a bitch!\n\nCut to AYAKO's computer desk. Pictures and files of TODD are hung up all around the desk.\n\nAYAKO (speaking Japanese): You told me you were an obscenely rich American entrepreneur. You had eighty dollars in your bank account. Eighty!\n\nTODD: Hey, I meant I was rich because I have friends, like George Bailey.\n\nAYAKO (speaking Japanese): Who the shit is George Bailey? Do you have any idea how much work went into scamming you? George Bailey!\n\nAYAKO hangs up.\n\nTODD: Hello? Well, I'm out of ideas.\n\nDIANE: We can hide out at my place while we make a plan.\n\nBOJACK rolls down one of the back seat windows and looks out. News helicopters are in pursuit of the car. An anthropomorphic pig man rises into view. His midsection is tied to a helium balloon. He snaps a picture of BOJACK.\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, great, just get me away from the cameras.\n\nINT. DIANE & MR. PEANUTBUTTER'S HOUSE\nBOJACK is flanked by two cameras. He is sitting at a dining table with MR. PEANUTBUTTER, PRINCESS CAROLYN, and TODD.\n\nBOJACK: Do we really need to be filming this?\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's for my reality show. You never know when gold's gonna strike.\n\nBOJACK: Yeah, gold doesn't strike.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's why you never know.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, be nice.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Just pretend they're not there.\n\nBOJACK: Okay. Well, I --\n\nSOUND GUY: Could you speak up, please?\n\nBOJACK (loudly): I'd like to --\n\nSOUND GUY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's too loud.\n\nBOJACK: I want to fix this as quickly as possible. I don't care who was right about the muffins anymore, even though I was definitely right. I just want my privacy back, so I can finish writing my tell-all memoir, so everyone will pay attention to me again.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: I've already reached out to the McBeal camp. He's willing to publicly forgive you if you publicly apologize and present to him a box of muffins as a symbol of your great admiration for the American military and everything they do.\n\nBOJACK: But I ate the muffins.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: I know. We got another box. It's in the cupboard.\n\nBOJACK: Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: We've been here for ten minutes! it's okay, we'll get more muffins.\n\nTODD: I'll get the muffins, and they're on me. I just found out I got 80 bucks in the bank. I'm helping! Hooray!\n\nTODD runs out the door.\n\nBOJACK: So where are we gonna do this? Do I have to go on MSNBSea?\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: No, we should do it somewhere people will actually see it.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, why don't you do it on Peanutbutter and Jelly?\n\nBOJACK: You can't call a show Peanutbutter and Jelly if there's no jelly.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's a pun.\n\nBOJACK: It's not a pun if it only works one way.\n\nPRINCESS CAROLYN: Is this a necessary conversation to be having right now?\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Look, I know tempers are high, but let's not take it out on the great title for my reality show, which we all agree is really clever.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER turns to the camera woman.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER (whispering): We can edit this to make me look smart, right?\n\nThe camera woman nods.\nCUT TO: DIANE & MR. PEANUTBUTTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT\nThe camera is focusing in on MR. PEANUTBUTTER's face.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: How's this look? Looks good? Okay.\n\nCAMERA MAN: Marker, sound, speed.\n\nThe camera pans back to reveal BOJACK and MR. PEANUTBUTTER sitting next to each other on adjacent couches.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, here I am, hanging out with my good friend BoJack Horseman, enjoying each other's company, as we often do.\n\nBOJACK: Yes, this is all very authentic and natural.\n\nThe doorbell rings. MR. PEANUTBUTTER's ears perk up.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, someone's at the door!\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER stands and addresses the camera.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER. I will see who it is.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER walks to the door and ushers NEAL MCBEAL into the room.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow, this is a surprise. Neal McBeal.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL (to MR. PEANUTBUTTER): Hello, sir. Thank you for inviting me into your home. It is lovely.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack, is there anything you'd like to give Neal McBeal?\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Ahem.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER gets up and walks out of the shot.\n\nBOJACK: Oh, yeah, Todd?\n\nTODD pops up from behind the couch with a brown bag.\n\nBOJACK: What the hell is this?\n\nTODD: I tried to buy the muffins, but my bank card got declined for some reason. But don't worry, I still saved the day because I found this bag of stale hamburger buns.\n\nBOJACK: I'm sorry?\n\nTODD: Yeah, they're just giving them away behind In-N-Out.\n\nTODD hands BOJACK the bag of buns.\n\nTODD: Why does anybody pay for anything?\n\nBOJACK shoves TODD back behind the couch.\n\nTODD: Ow.\n\nBOJACK: Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration, please acccept this bag of stale hamburger buns.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: What?\n\nBOJACK: Yes, hamburger buns. It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans in the trash, sadly, far too often.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: We send our muffins overseas, and they come back as stale hamburger buns, but that doesn't mean we should love them any less, because in their own way, aren't stale hamburger buns just as good?\n\nBOJACK eats one of the buns.\n\nBOJACK: Mmm...American made.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: So what you're saying is, you think I'm a hero.\n\nBOJACK: Well, I don't know if I --\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero.\n\nBOJACK: You're a hero. The troops are all heroes, every single one.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Great.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL grabs and tugs on the bag of hamburger buns, but BOJACK resists.\n\nBOJACK: And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Okay, you can let go of the bag now.\n\nBOJACK: Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Yeah, me neither. I think we're in agreement here.\n\nBOJACK: Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases.\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Okay.\n\nBOJACK: And finally, I don't --\n\nThe sound guy walks into the shot.\n\nSOUND GUY: Hey, look! Mr. Peanutbutter got a bucket stuck on his head.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Guys, guys, where am I? Can someone tell me where I am?\n\nNEAL MCBEAL: Hey, where'd he get that bucket from? Who gave him a bucket?\n\nNEAL MCBEAL laughs and walks off screen.\n\nBOJACK: Uh, actually, I had another point I wanted to make.\n\nTODD climbs over the couch.\n\nTODD: Yeah, but who doesn't love a dog with a bucket on his head? Come on. Bucket! Bucket!\n\nEveryone gathers around MR. PEANUTBUTTER.\n\nALL (minus BOJACK): Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, can anyone find a handle?\n\nThe camera girl pulls the bucket off his head. Everyone cheers.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, thank you, my friend. You're a real hero.\n\nBOJACK: Unbelievable.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: What's your name, young lady?\n\nCAMERA GIRL: Well, my real name's Angela, but my friends call me Jelly.\n\nMR. PEANUTBUTTER: What? Oh, my god, did we get that? Please tell me we got that.\n\nBOJACK leaves the scene. He climbs out the second floor window with the bag of stale hamburger buns. DIANE is sitting on the roof smoking a cigarette. He sits down next to her, then pulls out one of the buns.\n\nBOJACK: You want a day-old hamburger bun?\n\nDIANE: I'm all right. How'd it go down there?\n\nBOJACK: You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe. No one ever wants to hear the truth.\n\nDIANE: I want to hear the truth. I don't know if you want to tell it, though.\n\nBOJACK: What do you mean?\n\nDIANE: Mr. Normal Childhood, Mr. Uneventful Father? Look, I can write you the standard empty-calorie celebrity tell-some, if that's what you're looking for, but I thought you might want more than that.\n\nBOJACK: I do.\n\nDIANE: Well, then you're going to have to open up and give me something real.\n\nBOJACK: What, you think I can't open up?\n\nDIANE: Well, I don't know if you can or not. You certainly haven't.\n\nBOJACK: Okay, from now on, full truth, warts and all.\nYou're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you?\n\nDIANE: I don't know, are you an asshole?\n\nBOJACK: Okay, full truth, here we go.\nYou want to know about my parents? They drank a lot. My father was a failed novelist. My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune, and my dad resented her for it. He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records. He made me build my own tree house, and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp because instead of hearty, Christian nails, I used screws, which he called fancy Jew nails. Like I said, totally normal."
