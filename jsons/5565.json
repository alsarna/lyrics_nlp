(Uh-huh)\nAll the things we thought about\nThen never will have done happen again\nIf I could just see you\n[Pre-Chorus: Jesse McCartney]\nIf I had my way, I'd come and getcha, girl\nIn your favorite car with the missing top\nRemember 'round my way where we used to park\nAnd did all those things to steal your heart\n\n[Chorus: Jesse McCartney]\nIt's been about a year now\nAin't seen or heard from you\nI've been missing you crazy\nHow do you, how do you sleep?\nI found the letter you wrote me\nIt still smells just like you\nDamn, those sweet memories\nHow do you, how do you sleep?
