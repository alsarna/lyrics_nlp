Oh no. Oh no\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay\nFeeling like I do today\nIt's too much pain and too much sorrow\nGuess I'll feel the same tomorrow\n\n[Chorus]\nWell this could be the last time\nThis could be the last time\nMaybe the last time\nI don't know. Oh no. Oh no\nWell this could be the last time\nThis could be the last time\nMaybe the last time\nI don't know. Oh no. Oh no\n[Verse 3]\nWell I told you once and I told you twice\nThat someone will have to pay the price\nBut here's a chance to change your mind\nBecause I'll be gone a long, long time\n\n[Chorus]\nWell this could be the last time\nThis could be the last time\nMaybe the last time\nI don't know\nOh no. Oh no\n\n[Outro]\nMaybe the last time\n\nLast time, baby\nOh, no, no\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know"
