Oh no. Oh no\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay\nFeeling like I do today\nIt's too much pain and too much sorrow\nGuess I'll feel the same tomorrow\n[Chorus]\nWell this could be the last time\nThis could be the last time\nMaybe the last time\nI don't know. Oh no. Oh no\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nWell this could be the last time\nThis could be the last time\nMaybe the last time\nI don't know. Oh no. Oh no\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell I told you once and I told you twice\nThat someone will have to pay the price\nBut here's a chance to change your mind\nBecause I'll be gone a long, long time\n\n[Chorus]\nWell this could be the last time\nThis could be the last time\nMaybe the last time\nI don't know\nOh no. Oh no\n[Outro]\nLast time, baby\nTo see you no more\n(Baby the last time)\nNot no more\n(Baby the last time)\nWell not no more\n(Baby the last time)\nWell not no more\n(Baby the last time)\nAh, not no more\n(Baby the last time)\nNot no more\n(Baby the last time)\nNo, not no more\n(Baby the last time)\nNo, not no more\n(Baby the last time)\nNo, no I don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)\nI don't know\n(Baby the last time)2Embed"
