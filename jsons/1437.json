I know no\nYou don't mean it now\nSometimes I roam\nBut, I'll be coming back home\nSometimes, I seem to be fly\nI just don't know when to say, \"bye bye\"\nHey baby, baby\nI got that feelin' baby\nI have it, alright\n\nBaby, baby, baby\nBaby, baby, baby\nBaby, baby, baby\nBaby, baby\n\nCome on now\nCome on now\nOh, oh, oh..."
