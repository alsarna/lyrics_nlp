Singin'\n[Chorus]\nYou are\nYou are\nYou are\nYou are\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are\nYou are\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd nothing else compares\nOh, nothing else compares\nAnd nothing else compares\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are\nYou are\n\n[Outro]\nHome, home, where I wanted to go\nHome, home, where I wanted to go\nHome (You are) home, where I wanted to go\nHome (You are) home, where I wanted to go81Embed"
