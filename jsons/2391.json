    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHello, girl, it's been a while\nGuess you'll be glad to know\nThat I've learned how to laugh and smile\nGetting over you was slow\nThey say old lovers can be good friends\nBut I never thought I'd really see you\nI'd really see you again\n\n[Chorus]\nI go crazy\nWhen I look in your eyes, I still go crazy\nNo, my heart just can't hide\nThat old feelin' inside\nWay deep down inside\nOh, baby\nYou know when I look in your eyes I go crazy\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou say he satisfies your mind\nTells you all of his dreams\nI know how much that means to you\nI realize that I was blind\nJust when I thought I was over you\nI see your face and it just ain't true\nNo, it just ain't true\n[Chorus]\nI go crazy\nWhen I look in your eyes, I still go crazy\nThat old flame comes alive\nIt starts burning inside\nWay deep down inside\nOh, baby\nYou know when I look in your eyes I go crazy\n\n[Chorus]\nWhoa, whoa\nI go crazy\nYou know when I look in your eyes, I go crazy\nNo, my heart just can't hide\nThat old feelin' inside\nWay deep down inside\nI go crazy"
