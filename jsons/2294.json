How are you?\nHave you been alright\nThrough all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?\nThat's what I'd say\nI'd tell you everything\nIf you'd pick up that telephone\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey! How you feelin'?\nAre you still the same?\nDon't you realize the things we did, we did\nWere all for real, not a dream?\nI just can't believe\nThey've all faded out of view\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDoo-wop, do-be-do-do-wop\nDoo-wa-doo-day\nBlue days, black nights\nDoo-wa-doo-day\nI look into the sky\n(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)\nAnd I wonder why\n(The little things you planned ain't comin' true)\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight\n\n[Verse 3]\nOk, so no one's answering\nWell, can't you just let it ring a little longer, longer, longer?\nOh\nI'll just sit tight\nThrough shadows of the night\nLet it ring forevermore\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDoo-wop, do-be-do-do-wop\nDoo-wa-doo-day\nBlue days, black nights\nDoo-wa-doo-day\nI look into the sky\n(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)\nAnd I wonder why\n(The little things you planned ain't comin' true)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight"
