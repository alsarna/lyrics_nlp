Would it be a sin\nIf I can't help falling in love with you?\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a river flows\nSurely to the sea\nDarling, so it goes\nSome things are meant to be\n\n[Verse 3]\nTake my hand, take my whole life, too\nFor I can't help falling in love with you\n[Chorus]\nLike a river flows\nSurely to the sea\nDarling, so it goes\nSome things are meant to be\n\n[Outro]\nTake my hand, take my whole life, too\nFor I can't help falling in love with you\nFor I can't help falling in love with you112Embed"
