    "lyrics": "I like bread and butter\nI like toast and jam\nThat's what my baby feeds me\nI'm her loving man\n\nHe likes bread and butter\nHe likes toast and jam\nThat's what his baby feeds him\nHe's her loving man\n\nShe don't cook mashed potatoes\nShe don't cook T-bone steaks\nDon't feed me peanut butter\nShe knows that I can't take\n\nHe likes bread and butter\nHe likes toast and jam\nThat's what his baby feeds him\nHe's her loving man\n\nGot home early one morning\nMuch to my surprise\nShe was eating chicken and dumplings\nWith some other guy\n\nNo more bread and butter\nNo more toast and jam\nI found my baby eating\nWith some other man"
