They really pack 'em in\nThe in crowd say it's cool\nTo dig this chanting thing\nBut as the wind changed direction\nAnd the temple band took five\nThe crowd caught a whiff\nOf that crazy Casbah jive\n\n[Chorus]\nShareef don't like it\nRockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah\nShareef don't like it\nRockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe king called up his jet fighters\nHe said \"You better earn your pay\nDrop your bombs between the minarets\nDown the Casbah way\"\nAs soon as the Shareef was\nChauffeured outta there\nThe jet pilots tuned to\nThe cockpit radio blare\nAs soon as the Shareef was\nOut of their hair\nThe jet pilots wailed\n[Chorus]\nShareef don't like it\nRockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah\nShareef don't like it\nRockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah\n\n[Outro]\n(Shareef don't like it)\nThinks it’s not kosher\n(Rockin' the Casbah\nRock the Casbah)\n(Shareef don't like it)\nFundamentally can’t take it\n(Rockin' the Casbah\nRock the Casbah)\n(Shareef don't like it)\nYou know he really hates it\n(Rockin' the Casbah\nRock the Casbah)\n(Shareef don't like it)\nReally, really hates it"
