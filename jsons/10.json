I haven't seen you in many\nA year\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, baked a cake, baked a cake\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake\nHowdya do, howdya do, howdya do?\nHad you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band, grandest band in the land\nHad you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band\nAnd spread the welcome mat for you\nOh, I don't know where you came from\n'cause I don't know where you've been\nBut it really doesn't matter\nGrab a chair and fill your platter\nAnd dig, dig, dig right in\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, hired a band, goodness sake!\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake\nHowdya do, howdya do, howdya do?\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, baked a cake, baked a cake\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake\nHowdya do, howdya do, howdya do?\nHad you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band, grandest band in the land\nHad you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band\nSpread the welcome mat for you\nOh, I don't know where you came from\n'cause I don't know where you've been\nBut it really doesn't matter\nGrab a chair and fill your platter\nAnd dig, dig, dig right in\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, hired a band, goodness sake!\nIf I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake\nHowdya do, howdya do, howdya do?\nHowdya do, howdya do, howdya do?\nHowdya do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
