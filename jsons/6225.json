(Take you off my mind)\n\n[Chorus: Zara Larsson & MNEK, MNEK]\nI will never forget you\nYou will always be by my side (Be by my side)\nFrom the day that I met you (Day I met you)\nI knew that I would love you 'til the day I die\nAnd I will never want much more\nAnd in my heart, I will always be sure (Be sure)\nI will never forget you (Never forget you)\nAnd you will always be by my side 'til the day I die\n\n[Bridge: Zara Larsson & MNEK]\nFeelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do\nAnd all along, I knew I had somethin' special with you\nBut sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through\nBut I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you\nFeelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do\nAnd all along, I knew I had something special with you\nBut sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through\nI can't hide my connection with you\n[Chorus: Zara Larsson & MNEK, MNEK]\nI will never forget you\nAnd you will always be by my side (You will always be my)\nFrom the day that I met you (Day that I met you)\nI knew that I would love you 'til the day I die\nAnd I will never want much more\nAnd in my heart, I will always be sure (In my heart, I will be sure)\nThat I will never forget you (Never forget you)\nAnd you will always be by my side 'til the day I die\n\n[Outro: Zara Larsson, MNEK, Both]\nDie, yeah\n'Til the day I die, 'til the day I die, 'til the day I die\nOh yeah, yeah, oh\n'Til the day I die, 'til the day I die, 'til the day I die\nAnd you will always be by my side\nI will never forget you\nI will never, never, never, never\nNever, never, never, never\nI will never forget you 'til the day I die49Embed"
