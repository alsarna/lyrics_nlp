    "lyrics": "(time is an illusion)hook\nThis world's a fuckin big ben\nWhere the bullies of time increase your pain\nMy niggas count the money and pray the god\nPray the god to see tomorrow one more time\nMo hours mo minutes mo distress\nTime is a poison which acts so slowly\nNo caress ,no kisses ,for the realest\nJust blow,just cuts and that's it\n\nMy back 'gainst the wall\nHours all around me\n\nMy reason insensitive\nBut my heart feeling something\n\nTic toc tic tic toc\nTime is so fast\n\nTic toc toc tic toc\nYou already in the past\n\n\nWhat goes around comes around  justin timberlake\nTime is in the same time my richness and my huge poverty\nMinutes gives a rough ra to my pore head to my eyes man to my conscious to my reason\nIm feelin the time ,im feelin the punch\nI 'm runnin non stop after this kind of sand who's flow into my hand\nMy calcul control the world, my passion feelin it\nMy heart beat in the rythm,but my mind tyred"
