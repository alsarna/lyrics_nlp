(Ooooh)\nYou really don't want me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\nYou really don't need me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Stein]\nWhy do you keep comin' around\nPlaying with my heart?\nWhy don't you get out of my life\nAnd let me try to make a new start?\nLet me get over you\nThe way you've gotten over me\n\n[Chorus: Mark Stein with Vince Martell (Tim Bogert & Carmine Appice)]\nSet me free, why don't you babe?\nGet out my life, why don't you now? (Ooooh)\nYou really don't want me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\nYou really don't need me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\n\n[Verse 2: Mark Stein]\nYou said, when we broke up\nYou just wanna be friends\nBut how can we still be friends\nWhen seeing you only breaks my heart again\nAnd there ain't nothing I can do about it\n(Give it to me)\n[Bridge: Mark Stein with Vince Martell (Tim Bogert & Carmine Appice)]\nYou know I need love\n(Set me free, why don't you babe?)\nTalkin' 'bout love\n(Get out my life, why don't you babe?) (Ooooh)\nYou really don't want me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\nYou really don't need me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\n\n[Refrain: Mark Stein (Tim Bogert & Carmine Appice)]\nGet out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooooh)\nGet out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooooh)\nGet out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooooh)\nGet out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooooh)\n\n[Outro: Mark Stein]\n(Hey!)\n(Come on to me, yeah!)\n(Come on)"
