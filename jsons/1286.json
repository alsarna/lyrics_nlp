    "lyrics": "I know I stand in line until you think\nYou have the time to spend an evening with me\nAnd if we go someplace to dance\nI know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me\nAnd afterwards we drop into a quiet little place\nAnd have a drink or two\nAnd then I go and spoil it all by saying\nSomething stupid like I love you\n\nI can see it in your eyes that you despise\nThe same old lines you heard the night before\nAnd though it's just a line to you for me it's true\nAnd never seemed so right before\n\nI practice everyday to find some clever lines\nTo say to make the meaning come true\nBut then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late\nAnd I'm alone with you\nThe time is right your perfume fills my head\nThe stars get red and on the nights so blue\nAnd then I go and spoil it all by saying\nSomething stupid like I love you\nThe time is right your perfume fills my head\nThe stars get red and on the nights so blue\nAnd then I go and spoil it all by saying\nSomething stupid like I love you\nI love you, I love you, I love you..."
