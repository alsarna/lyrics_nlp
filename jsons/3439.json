Oh\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nOh, oh, oh-woah\nWoah, girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad?\n(Treat ya, treat ya, treat ya) Oh\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nOh, oh, oh-woah\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirl, you must resist\nDon't let him squirm his way into your heart\nNo, girl, I must insist\nYou've got to stop the fool before he starts\nJust remember how he was so untrue\nWith all the tacky things he did to you\nNo need to signify, 'cause he's not worth your time\nYou need to find someone that's true to you\n\n[Chorus]\nGirlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nOh, oh, oh-woah\nGirlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? (Treat ya, treat ya)\nBaby, don't be sad (Oh), no\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nOh, oh, oh-woah\n[Post-Chorus]\nTo believe or not to believe\nThat is the question\nIt just takes a street degree\nYou've lied your last lie and I've cried my last cry\nI'm out the door, babe\nThere's other fish in the sea (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Bridge]\nCute, cute, cute, cute\nHey, Deele, sing!\nTo believe or not to believe\nThat is the question\nIt just takes a street degree\nYou've lied your last lie and I've cried my last cry\nI'm out the door, babe\nThere's other fish in the sea\n\n[Chorus]\nGirlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad?\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nGirlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nOh, oh, oh-woah\nGirlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nOh, oh, oh-woah\n[Chorus]\nGirlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad?

(Treat ya, treat ya)\nBaby, don't be sad (Oh), no\nGirlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had\nOh, oh, oh-woah\n\n[Refrain]\nDon't let him put you down\nGirl, he's been messing around\nYou've been used, abused\nSo, baby, make your move\nYou've learned your lesson now\nSo, turn this hurt around\nDon't be no fool, 'cause you've got to bust loose\nGirlfriend, yeah\nHow could you let him treat you so bad? Oh\nOh, girlfriend\nYou know you were the best he ever had (You know you were the best he ever had, girl)\nOh, oh, oh-woah\n\n[Outro]\nDon't let him put you down\nGirl, he's been messing around\nYou've been used, abused\nSo, baby, make your move\nYou've learned your lesson now\nSo, turn this hurt around\nDon't be no fool, 'cause you've got to bust loose\nGirlfriend, yeah\nHow could you let him treat you so bad?
