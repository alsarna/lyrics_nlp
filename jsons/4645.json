Oh yeah\nEvery night when we say goodbye\nHow can I help looking in your eyes?\nWondering why that you and I haven't hit it\nCan we get it on?\n\n[Chorus: Soul Decision]\nI'm kind of faded, but I feel alright\nThinking about making my move tonight\nI can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holding my body tight\n'Cause I like the way you're making your move\nI like the way you're making me wait\nAt the end of the night, when I make up your mind\nYou'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah\n[Verse 2: Soul Decision]\nYeah, you know you got it\nAnd you know I want it\nI can't wait to take you home (You know you've got it tonight)\nI don't wanna be rude at all\nI just wanna be where you go\nThink what we could do alone (Yeah)\n\n[Bridge: Soul Decision]\nCouldn't we do what we did last night again?\nBaby, you and I'd be better friends\nDon't you think it's time we went a bit further? Oh yeah\nEvery night when we say goodbye\nHow can I help looking in your eyes?\nWondering why that you and I haven't hit it\nCan we get it on?\n\n[Chorus: Soul Decision]\nI'm kind of faded, but I feel alright\nThinking about making my move tonight\nI can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holding my body tight\n'Cause I like the way you're making your move\nI like the way you're making me wait\nAt the end of the night, when I make up your mind\nYou'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah\n[Verse 3: Thrust]\nUh, uh, when we first met, yo, that deal was stated\nYou stepped like my steez the way we conversated\nJust another day\nJust around the way\nPut me up close with everything okay\n'Cause I'm-\nNot like the rest\nIndescision with the best\nThoughts for my full court press\nJust because they hated\nHow's it go? HA, yo faded\n\n[Chorus: Soul Decision]\nI'm kind of faded, but I feel alright\nThinking about making my move tonight (Move tonight)\nI can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holding my body tight (Oh yeah)\n'Cause I like the way you're making your move\nI like the way you're making me wait\nAt the end of the night, when I make up your mind\nYou'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm kind of faded, but I feel alright\nThinking about making my move tonight\nI can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holding my body tight (My body tight)\n'Cause I like the way you're making your move\nI like the way you're making me wait\nAt the end of the night, when I make up your mind\nYou'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm kind of faded, but I feel alright\nThinking about making my move tonight\nI can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holding my body tight\n'Cause I like the way you're making your move\nI like the way you're making me wait\nAt the end of the night, when I make up your mind\nYou'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah"
