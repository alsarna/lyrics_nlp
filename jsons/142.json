    "lyrics": "Hold My Hand LyricsSo this the kingdom of Heaven\nSo this is the sweet Promised Land\nWhile angels tell of love\nDon't break the spell of love, hold my hand\n\nSo this is the garden of Eden\nIn dreams it was never so grand\nLet's never leave again\nAdam and Eve again, hold my hand\n\nThis is the secret of what bliss is\nFor bliss is what your kiss is\nAt last I understand\n\nSo this is the kingdom of Heaven\nAnd here on the threshold we stand\nPass through the portal now\nWe'll be immortal now, hold my hand\nSo this is the kingdom of heaven\nAnd here on the threshold we stand\nPass through the portal now\nWe'll be immortal now, hold my hand\nHold my handEmbed"
