    "lyrics": "I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed\nStretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead\nIt seems to last forever and time goes slowly by\nTill babe and me's together, then it starts to fly\n\n'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight\nThe moment that he's with me, everything's alright\nNight time is the right time, we make love\nThen it's his and my time, we take off\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\n\nHe takes me to a movie or to a restaurant\nTo go slow dancing, anything I want\nOnly when he's with me, I catch light\nOnly when he gives me, makes me feel alright\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\nAll day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly\nI'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)\nWhen he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight\nWork all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night\n\nMy baby takes the morning train\nHe works from nine to five and then\nHe takes another home again\nTo find me waitin' for him\n\n(My baby takes the morning train)\nHe's always on that morning train\n(He works from nine to five and then)\nHe works so hard\n(He takes another home again)\nTo find me waiting for him\n\n(My baby takes the morning train)\n(He works from nine to five and then)\n(He takes another home again)\n(To find me waitin' for him)"
