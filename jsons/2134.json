    "lyrics": "Long distance directory assistance area code 212\nSay hey, A and R, this is Mister Rhythm And Blues\nHe said, \"Hello\" and put me on hold\nTo say the least the cat was cold\nHe said, \"Don't call us child, we'll call you\"\n(I said, \"You got my number?\"\nHe said, \"Yeah, I got it when you walked in the door\")\nDon't call us, we'll call you\nDon't call us, we'll call you\nI got your name from a friend of a friend\nWho said he used to work with you\nRemember the all night creature from Stereo Ninety Two\nYeah, I said, \"Could you relate to our quarter track tape\nYou know the band performs in the nude\"\nHe said, \"Uh huh don't call us child, we'll call you\"\nListen kid, you paid for the call\nYou ain't bad but we've heard it all before\nYeah, it sounds like John, Paul and George\nAny way we cut a hit and we toured a bit\nWith a song he said, he couldn't use\nAnd now he calls and begs and crawls, it's telephone Deja Vu\nWe got percentage points and lousy joints\nAnd all the glitter we can use\nMama so uh huh, don't call us, now we'll call you\nListen kid, you paid for the call\nYou ain't bad but I've heard it all before\nDon't call us, we'll call you"
