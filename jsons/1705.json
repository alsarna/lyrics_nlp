    "lyrics": "I got up this morning\nWhile I was having my coffee\nMy woman came in, sat down by my side\nWith tears in her eyes\nShe said 'I've a confession to make.'\nI said 'Woman, speak what's on your mind.'\nShe said 'I've found somebody new\nTo take your place.'\n'I said don't feel so all alone\nI've found someone of my own.'\n'All those lonely nights\nYou left me all alone\nMy true love would call\nAnd talk to me on the phone.'\nI said 'Woman, if that's the way it's gotta be\nThen darlin, don't you worry about me.'\nShe said ' I've found somebody new\nTo take your place.'\n'I said don't feel so all alone\nI've found someone of my own.'\nI got up from the table\nReached down and wiped the tears\nFrom her face\nI put out my cigarette\nTurned and walked away\nShe said 'I've found somebody new\nTo take your place.'\n'I said don't feel so all alone\nI've found someone of my own.'"
