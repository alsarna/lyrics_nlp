Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah\nYou’ve got to show me love\n\n[Verse 1]\nHeartbreaks and promises, I’ve had more than my share\nI’m tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere\nWhat I need is somebody who really cares\nI really need a lover, a lover who wants to be there\nIt’s been so long since I touched a wanting hand\nI can’t put my love on the line, that I hope you’ll understand\n\n[Chorus]\nSo baby if you want me\nYou’ve got to show me love\nWords are so easy to say, alright?\nYou’ve got to show me love\n[Verse 2]\nI’m tired of getting caught up in those one night affairs\nWhat I really need is somebody who will always be there\nDon’t you promise me the world, all that I’ve already heard\nThis time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words\n\nIf you’re looking for devotion, talk to me\nCome with your heart in your hands\nBecause my love is guaranteed\n\n[Chorus]\nSo baby if you want me\nYou’ve got to show me love\nWords are so easy to say, alright?\nYou’ve got to show me love\n\n[Bridge]\nShow me, show me baby\nShow me, show me baby\nShow me, show me baby\nShow me, show me baby\n\nHeartbreaks and promises, I’ve had more than my share\nI’m tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere\nWhat I really need is somebody who will always be there\nThis time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words\nIf you’re looking for devotion, talk to me\nCome with your heart in your hands\nBecause my love is guaranteed\n\n[Chorus]\nSo baby if you want me\nYou’ve got to show me love\nWords are so easy to say, alright?\nYou’ve got to show me love\n\nThere’s nothing that you can tell me\nYou’ve got to show me love\nThere’s only one key to my heart\nYou’ve got to show me love5Embed"
