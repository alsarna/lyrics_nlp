    "lyrics": "On the Street Where You Live LyricsOh, the towering feeling\nJust to know somehow you are near\n\nI have often walked on this street before\nBut the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before\nAll at once am I several stories high\nKnowing I'm on the street where you live\n\nAre there lilac trees in the heart of town?\nCan you hear a lark in any other part of town?\nDoes enchantment pour out of every door?\nNo, it's just on the street where you live\n\nOh, the towering feeling\nJust to know somehow you are near\nThe overpowering feeling\nThat any second you may suddenly appear\nPeople stop and stare, they don't bother me\nFor there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be\nLet the time go by, I won't care if I\nCan be here on the street where you liveEmbed"
