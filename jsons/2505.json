    "lyrics": "Donâ€™t Cry Out Loud LyricsBaby cried the day the circus came to town\n'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her\nSo she painted on a smile and took up with some clown\nWhile she danced without a net upon the wire\nI know a lot about her, 'cause you see\nBaby is an awful lot like me\n\nDon't cry out loud\nJust keep it inside\nAnd learn how to hide your feelings\nFly high and proud\nAnd if you should fall\nRemember you almost had it all\n\nBaby saw that when they pulled that big top down\nThey left behind her dreams among the litter\nAnd the different kind of love she thought she'd found\nThere was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter\nBut Baby can't be broken, 'cause you see\nShe had the finest teacher, that was me\nI told her\nDon't cry out loud\nJust keep it inside\nAnd learn how to hide your feelings\nFly high and proud\nAnd if you should fall\nRemember you almost had it all\n\nDon't cry out loud\nJust keep it inside\nAnd learn how to hide your feelings\nFly high and proud\nAnd if you should fall\nRemember you almost made it\n\nDon't cry out loud\nJust keep it inside\nAnd learn how to hide your feelings\nFly high and proud\nAnd if you should fall\nRemember you almost had it allEmbed"
