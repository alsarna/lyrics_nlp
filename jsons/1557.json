    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair\nRuby, are you contemplating going out somewhere?\nThe shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down\n\n[Refrain 1]\nOh, Ruby\nDon't take your love to town\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war\nBut I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore\nAnd yes, it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be\n\n[Refrain 2]\nOh, Ruby\nI still need some company\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed\nAnd the wants and the needs of a woman of your age\nRuby, I realize\nBut it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around\n\n[Refrain 1]\nOh, Ruby\nDon't take your love to town\n[Verse 3]\nShe's leavin' now 'cause I just heard the slammin' of the door\nThe way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before\nAnd if I could move, I'd get my gun and put her in the ground\n\n[Refrain 1]\nOh, Ruby\nDon't take your love to town\n\n[Refrain 3]\nOh, Ruby\nFor God sake's, turn around"
