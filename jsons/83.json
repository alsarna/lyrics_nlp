    "lyrics": "Well, now gee, but it's great after stayin' out late\nWalkin' my baby back home\nArm and arm over meadow and farm\nWalkin' my baby back home\n\nWe go along harmonizing a song\nOr I'm reciting a poem\nThe owls go by and they give me the eye\nWalkin' my baby back home\n\nWe stop for a while, she gives me a smile\nAnd cuddles her cheek to my chest\nWe start into pet and that's when I get\nHer powder all over my vest\n\nAnd just when I try to straighten my tie\nShe wants to borrow my comb\nOne kiss and then we continue again\nWalkin' my baby back home\n\nWell gee, but it's great after stayin' out late\nWalkin' my baby back home\nWell, arm and arm over meadow and farm\nWalkin' my baby home\n\nWell, we go along singin' a song\nI'm recitin' a poem\nWell, the owls go by and they give me the eye\nWalkin' my baby back home\nWe stop for a while, she gives me a smile\nAnd cuddles her cheek to my chest\nWell, we start into pet and that's when I get\nHer powder all over my vest\n\nAnd just when I try to straighten my tie\nShe wants to borrow my comb\nOne kiss and then we do it again\nWalkin' my baby back home"
