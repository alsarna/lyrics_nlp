Just might run a pool table?\nRoll your eyes if I call you an angel, ain't you one of them girls?\nAsk you to dance, you say \"No\" just to see how far I'll go\nYour song comes on and your eyes close, that's when I know, yeah\nYou got your heart on lock down, got a wall I gotta knock down\nKinda wanna do a shot now, come on now\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you're one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody\nYou're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah\nYou're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number\nYou like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you're one of them girls, 'cause I'm one of them boys\nWould trade his whole world, hm, yeah\nFor one of them girls who likes to act all quiet, sexy, not even tryin'\nYeah, you know I ain't lyin', damn right\nYou one of them girls, broke every heart in your hometown\nOn the day you rode out, got 'em all wishin' on stars now\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I find one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody\nYou're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah\nYou're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number\nYou like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder\n[Post-Chorus]\nIf you're one of them girls\nWell, I'm one of them boys\nWould trade his whole world, hm, yeah\nFor one of them girls\n\n[Bridge]\nYou're one of them girls\nI wanna put my lips on\nHold all night long\nWrite a little love song\n\n[Chorus]\nFor one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody\nYou're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah\nYou're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number\nYou like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIf you're one of them girls\nWell, I'm one of them boys\nWould trade his whole world, his whole world\nFor one of them girls\n\n[Outro]\nHmm, one of them girls"
