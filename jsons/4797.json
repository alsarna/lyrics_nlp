    "lyrics": "[Round 1: John John Da Don]\nI said for years, I heard I took Hollow's name and I steal bars\nAnd y'all had the nerve to book this shit on Hallows Lane? At the Steel Yard?\nBut ain't no need to wonder what kinda angles I'm about to take\n'Cause out the gate, we gon' get this multiple choice out the way\nShould I A: Give him gun bars, 'cause that's what my people love?\nOr B: Prove I'm more of a Don than he ever was?\nOr C: Bring up that time we was brawlin' in the club?\nYo, London, y'all know the answer, right?\n(ALL OF THE ABOVE!)\nI got a bullet, with somebody's government on it\nIt's time to send it\nThey don't need to ask the name on this Hollow, 'cause Nigel been it (Bennett)\nWhat'chu gon' do? Pull out paperwork? Have some kinda gimmick?\n'Til I blow your brains all over that L.O.M. brand\nThat should help you mind ya business\nThis was booked for Houston, 'til his people told him that he shouldn't do it\nTried to warn him to not appear (a peer) pressure like a good influence\nNever seen a duck before?\n\n(*John John pulls out a handheld mirror*)\n\nHere's one, lookin' stupid\nBut the last time we seen Hollow in the mirror is when I put him through it!\nBut let me guess, to beat you, I'ma need a bunch of random shit\nLike Xanny scripts from Anna Smith\nEvander's fist and Santa's list? Wrong\nHow 'bout smoke from a Sig' (cig')? Call it my \"cancer stick\"\nSlanted clips that goes both ways: that's a banana split\nThat hammer lift, I'll put the grip on his cheek like when granny pinch\nWhen you go, ya son go, your girl, make it a family trip\nI was gon' get him separate ways, but I don't like seein' families split\nSo I got him all in one shot, that's a family pic (pick)\nBut why we never see you wit' a chick?\nI gotta watch this guy\nI mean, not even the mother of ya child? What'chu got to hide?\nI think you bi, and live a pair of lies (paralyze) so you can't stand it\nNo wonder you named yourself \"Hollow\", 'cause you the trans parent (transparent)\n{Hollow pulls out a sign that says \"He Stole That Line\"}\n\nBut what's ya son name again? Lennon?\nLook, Lennon, I know ya mom trippin'\n'Cause Daddy don't wanna make her an honest woman so you gettin' raised off of my whippings\nNext time he go to discipline you, you tell him he wastin' his time, Lennon\nUntil Mommy get the biggest rock band ever\nEvery beat'll (Beatle) be coming from John, Lennon!\nBut please don't say the John if you ain't sayin' it twice!\nAnd if you don't add \"Da Don\", you ain't sayin' it right!\nWant some advice? Change ya name 'cause you not no Don, bro\nBut he can say it twice like me, so I can hollow Hollow\nNow hollow Hollow or Hollow hollow\nTalkin' headshot, leg shot, how low Hollow?\nNo, red dot, dead shot, I'll high-low Hollow\nLaughin', under my breath \"hee-hee-ha-llow\" Hollow\nBut y'all said I got my name from him? Fuck no, never\nYou had no influence on my career whatsoever\nI don't drink syrup or profit off of taxes for cheap shirts\nAnd post importantly, I would never lose a fight if I swing first\nNow I'mma prove he ain't nothin' like how he appear to y'all\nAnd I got the perfect way to do this\nHollow, let's play \"Swear To God\"\nSwear to God, you ain't ask me to not bring up the fight and made me sign an NDA\nDon't worry\n{John John brings out the supposed NDA contract}\n\nThis the Non Disclosure Agreement, but guess what?\nNigga fuck you, I'ma talk about it anyway\nAye, I know y'all heard the rumors, I'm not sayin' that they all the truth\nBut if I didn't beat yo' ass, when you swung on me first, why did they have to pull me off of you?\nBut that's old Hollow\nDidn't he pull out that jacket vers' Ars' to be the \"old Hollow\"?\nWhat if I told y'all I brought the jacket I wore when we fought to finish this beatin' I owed Hollow?\n\n{John John acts like he's going to pull out the jacket}\n\nGot him!\nAye, nah, nah, nah, but truth be told Hollow, we ain't really scrap dawg\nI mean, you swung, missed, I swung, hit and broke the mirror wit'chu, that's all\nAs far as Calicoe jumpin' in? That was a fact, y'all\nAyo, Twork, they ain't know it was me\nStandin' over the body with my glasses and my hat off!\nI'm only here 'cause I'm gettin' that cash!\nIt's a body, and it's time for you to get in that bag!\nMatter of fact, scratch that\nCan't even use that slogan, it doesn't feel right\n'Cause I already whipped that ass - in real life!\nTime, nigga!\n\n[Round 1: Hollow Da Don]\nYoooooooooo!\nI said, Hollow Da Don in London, versus-\nI'm 'bout to fuck you up, nigga!\nY'all really gon' call him \"John John\" when he get split in two\nGet the blade from my nigga in London {*clap-clap*}\nAnd that leads (Leeds) to a liver pool (Liverpool)!\nHow dare you call me scared?
