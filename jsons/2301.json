(In Southern sky)\nIts precious beauty lies just beyond the eye\nIt goes runnin' through your soul\nLike the stories told of old\n\n[Verse 4]\nOld man\nHe and his dog, they walk the old land\nEvery flower touched his cold hand\nAs he slowly walked by\nWeepin' willows would cry for joy, joy\n[Verse 5]\nFeels so good\nFeels so good, it's frightening\nWish I could\nStop this world from fighting\nLa-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da\n\n[Verse 6]\nMystery\nLike this and many others in the trees\nBlow in the night\nIn the Southern skies\n\n[Verse 7]\nSouthern nights\nThey feel so good, it's a frightening\nWish I could (Southern nights)\nStop this world from the fighting\nDa-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da\n\n[Outro]\nSouthern skies\nHave you ever noticed?"
