    "lyrics": "When I call you up, your line's engaged\nI have had enough, so act your age\nWe have lost the time that was so hard to find\nAnd I will lose my mind, if you won't see me\nYou won't see me\n\nI don't know why you should want to hide\nBut I can't get through, my hands are tied\nI won't want to stay, I don't have much to say\nBut I can turn away if you won't see me\nYou won't see me\n\nTime after time you refuse to even listen\nI wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'\n\nThough the days are few, they're filled with tears\nAnd since I lost you, it feels like years\nYes, it seems so long since you've been gone\nAnd I just can't go on, if you won't see me\nYou won't see me\n\nTime after time you refuse to even listen\nI wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'\n\nThough the days are few, they're filled with tears\nAnd since I lost you, it feels like years\nYes, it seems so long since you've been gone\nAnd I just can't go on, if you won't see me\nYou won't see me..."
