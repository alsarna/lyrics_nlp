    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen dreaming I'm guided to another world\nTime and time again\nAt sunrise I fight to stay asleep\nBecause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place\nBecause there's a hunger, a longing to escape\nFrom the life I live when I'm awake\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo let's go there\nLet's make our escape\nCome on, let's go there\nLet's ask, \"Can we stay?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place where blind men see\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place with golden streets\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlthough I would like our world to change\nIt helps me to appreciate\nThose nights and those dreams\nBut, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights\nIf I could make the Earth and my dreams the same\nThe only difference is\nTo let love replace all our hate\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo let's go there\nLet's make our escape\nCome on, let's go there\nLet's ask, \"Can we stay?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place where blind men see\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place with golden streets\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo let's go there\nLet's make our escape\nCome on, let's go there\nLet's ask, \"Can we stay?\"\n\n[Bridge]\nUp high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time\nSet up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine\nSet up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place where blind men see\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place with golden streets\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place where blind men see\nCan you take me higher?\nTo a place with golden streets"
