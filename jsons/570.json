    "lyrics": "You're so fine, you're so fine\nYou're mine, you're mine\nI walk, and I talk, about you\nI love you, I love you\nI need you, I need you\nI walk, and I talk, about you\nThere's nothing in the world as sweet as your kiss\nSo fine, so fine\nEverytime we meet, my heart skips a beat\nYou're my first cup of coffee\n( my last cup of tea) Bass line\nYou're so fine, you're so fine\nYou're mine, you're mine\nI walk, and I talk, about you\nSax solo\nYou're so fine, you're so fine\nYou're mine, you're mine\nI walk, and I talk, about you"
