    "lyrics": "I don't mind\n\nWhy don't you do what you do\nWhen you did what you did to me?\nLove was so good that it filled up all my needs\n\nI was crazy for you\nYou were crazy for me\nHow could something so right go so wrong\nMy love, sweet love\n\nWhy don't you say what you say\nWhen you say what you said anymore?\nYour eyes couldn't lie\nSo long goodbye, close the door\n\nI was crazy for you\nYou were crazy for me\nHow could something so right go so wrong\nMy love, sweet love\n\nTell me something I didn't do\nWhy did someone else have to pull you through?\nDid they steal you away like a thief in the night?\nLove like this must take flight\nWhy don't they play what they played\nOn the nights you danced with me?\nRemember the one we made love to endlessly\n\nI was crazy for you\nYou were crazy for me\nAnd how could something so right go so wrong\nMy love, sweet love\n\nWhy don't you do what you do\nWhen you did what you did to me?\nDo what you do when you did what you did to me\nDo what you do when you did what you did to me\nDo what you do when you did what you did to me"
