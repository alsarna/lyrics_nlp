    "lyrics": "The Walk LyricsWell I know you heard of Suzy-Q\nAnd I know you heard of the chicken too\nI know you heard of the cha-cha-choo\nCause the walk is a dance that you can do\nYou just walk, you just walk\nOh you walk, yes you walk\nYeah you walk, it has to walk\nWell I know you heard of the Texas Hop\nI know you heard of the old Fox Trot\nBut when you do The Walk\nYou ride each car\nYou just shake your hips and close your eyes\nAnd then you walk, yeah you walk\nThen you walk, oh you walk, ah you walk\nOh yes you walk\nDo the walk, boys!\n[Instrumental]\nWell I know you heard of the old mambo\nAnd I know you heard of the old congo\nBut when you do the walk\nYou're startin to get close\nAnd don't step on your partners toes!\nYou just walk, yeah you walk, then you walk\nYes you walk, oh you walk, just the walk\nNow if you don't know what it's all about\nCome to me and I'll show you how\nWell do it fast, well do it slow\nThen you'll know the walk everywhere you go\nYou can walk, and you walk, now you walk\nYou gonna walk, you gotta walk it\nJust a walk\nJust a walk\nJust a walk\nJust a walkEmbed"
