    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been down\nNow I'm blessed\nI felt a revelation comin' around\nI guess it's right, it's so amazing\nEvery time I see you, I'm alive\nYou're all I've got\nYou lift me up\nThe sun and the moonlight\nAll my dreams are in your eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wanna be inside your heaven\nTake me to the place you cry from\nWhere the storm blows your way\nI wanna be the earth that holds you\nEvery bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind\nI wanna be inside your heaven\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen we touch\nWhen we love\nThe stars light up, the wrong becomes undone\nNaturally, my soul surrenders\nThe sun and the moonlight\nAll my dreams are in your eyes\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wanna be inside your heaven\nTake me to the place you cry from\nWhen the storm blows your way\nI wanna be the earth that holds you\nEvery bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind\nI wanna be inside your heaven\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen minutes turn to days and years\nIf mountains fall, I'll still be here\nHolding you until the day I die\nAnd I wanna be inside your heaven\nTake me to the place you cry from\nWhere the storm blows you away\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna be inside your heaven\nTake me to the place you cry from (Wanna be inside)\nWhere the storm blows your way\nAnd I wanna be inside your heaven\nTake me to the place you cry from\nWhere the storm blows your way\nAnd I wanna be the earth that holds you\nEvery bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind\nI wanna be inside your heaven"
