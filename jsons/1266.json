    "lyrics": "From the time I fall asleep\n'Til the mornin' comes I dream about\nYou, baby\nAnd I feel alright\n'Cause I know tonight I'll be with\nYou, baby\nAnd who makes me feel like smilin'\nWhen the weary day is through?\n\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n\nThey say candy is sweet\nBut it just can't compete with\nYou, baby\nYou've got everything I need\nAnd nobody can please like\nYou do, baby\nAnd who believes all my wildest dreams\nAnd my craziest schemes will come true?\n\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n\nA little ray of sunshine\nA little bit of soul\nAdd just a touch of magic\nYou got the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)"
