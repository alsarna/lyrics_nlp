    "lyrics": "Let me tell you about a place\nSomewhere up a New York way\nWhere the people are so gay\nTwisting the night away\nHere they have a lot of fun\nPutting trouble on the run\nMan, you find the old and young\nTwisting the night away\n\nThey're twisting, twisting\nEverybody's feeling great\nThey're twisting, twisting\nThey're twisting the night away\n\nHere's a man in evening clothes\nHow he got here, I don't know, but\nMan, you oughta see him go\nTwisting the night away\nHe's dancing with a chick in slacks\nShe's moving up and back\nOh, man, there ain't nothing like\nTwisting the night away\n\nThey're twisting, twisting\nEverybody's feeling great\nThey're twisting, twisting\nThey're twisting the night\nLet's twist a while\nLean up\nLean back\nLean up\nLean back\nWatusi\nNow fly\nNow twist\nThey're twisting the night away\n\nHere's a fella in blue jeans\nDancing with an older queen\nWho's dolled up in her diamond rings and\nTwisting the night away\nMan, you oughta see her go\nTwisting to the rock and roll\nHere you find the young and old\nTwisting the night away\n\nThey're twisting, twisting, man\nEverybody's feeling great\nThey're twisting, twisting\nThey're twisting the night\n\nOne more time\nLean up\nLean back\nLean up\nLean back\nWatusi\nNow fly\nNow twist"
