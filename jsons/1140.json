    "lyrics": "If you need someone to count on\nCount me in\nSomeone you can rely on\nThrough thick and thin\n\nWhen you start to count\nThe ones that you might ever doubt\nIf you think of counting me\nCount me out\n\nWhen you count the ones that want you\nCount me, too\nAnd if I'm not first on your list\nCount me blue\n\nJust be sure you count on me\nAnd when the countings through\nCount me madly in love with you\n\nIf you need someone to count on\nWhen you're down\nAnd all your other friends you've lost\nCount me found\n\nJust be sure you count on me\nWhen you're down and out\nCount me in through thick and thin\nOr it don't count\nWhen you count the ones that want you\nCount me, too\nAnd if I'm not first on your list\nCount me blue\n\nJust be sure you count on me\nAnd when the countings through\nCount me madly in love with you"
