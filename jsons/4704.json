Forever, ever?\nForever never seems that long until you're grown\nAnd notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong\nMs. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could\nBecome a magician to abracadabra all the sadder\nThoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he\nAsking what happened to the feeling that her and me had\nI pray so much about it, need some knee pads\nIt happened for a reason, one can't be mad\nSo know this, know that everything's cool\nAnd yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation\n[Chorus: André 3000]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\n\"Look at the way he treats me\"\nShit, look at the way you treat me\nYou see, your little nosy-ass homegirls\nDone got your ass sent up the creek, G\nWithout a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out\nNow you and your girl ain't speakin' no more\n'Cause my dick all in her mouth\nKnow what I'm talkin' about?\nJealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating\nIn the year 2G, they be the same thing\nSo who you placin' the blame on?\nYou keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones\nAnd you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama\n[Chorus: André 3000]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times157Embed"
