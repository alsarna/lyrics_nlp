    "lyrics": "It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping\nI can't imagine living my life after you're gone\nWondering why so many questions have no answers\nI keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong\n\nWhere is our yesterday\nYou and I could use it right now\nBut if this is goodbye...\n\nJust take my heart when you go\nI don't have the need for it anymore\nI'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold\nJust take my heart when you go\n\nHere we are about to take the final step now\nI just can't fool myself, I know there's no turning back\nFace to face it's been an endless conversation\nBut when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk\n\nI'd give my everything\nIf only I could turn you around\nBut if this is goodbye...\n\nJust take my heart when you go\nI don't have the need for it anymore\nI'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold\nJust take my heart when you go"
