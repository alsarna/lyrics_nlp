    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou took my heart, and you held it in your mouth\nAnd with a word, all my love came rushing out\nAnd every whisper, it's the worst\nEmptied out by a single word\nThere is a hollow in me now\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll put my faith in something unknown\nI'm living on such sweet nothing\nBut I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold\nI'm living on such sweet nothing\nAnd it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love\nWhen you're giving me such sweet nothing\nSweet nothing, sweet nothing\nYou're giving me such sweet nothing\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt isn't easy for me to let it go\n'Cause I've swallowed every single word\nAnd every whisper, every sigh\nEats away at this heart of mine\nAnd there is a hollow in me now\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll put my faith in something unknown\nI'm living on such sweet nothing\nBut I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold\nI'm living on such sweet nothing\nAnd it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love\nWhen you're giving me such sweet nothing\nSweet nothing, sweet nothing\nYou're giving me such sweet nothing\n[Bridge]\nAnd it's not enough to tell me that you care\nWhen we both know the words are empty air\nYou give me nothing\nNothing\n\n[Outro]\nSweet nothing\nSweet nothing"
