    "lyrics": "The love between the two of us was dying\nAnd it got so bad I knew I had to leave\nBut halfway down that highway when I turned around I saw\nMy little daughter running after me\nCrying\n\nDaddy, don't you walk so fast\nDaddy, don't you walk so fast\nDaddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run\nDaddy, don't you walk so fast\n\nNow, it broke my heart to tell my little daughter\nThat her daddy had to run to catch a train\nShe had no way of knowin' I was leavin' home for good\nI turned around and there she was again\nAs she said to me\n\nDaddy, don't you walk so fast\nMy daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast\nDaddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run\nDaddy, don't you walk so fast\n\nIf only for the sake of my sweet daughter\nI just had to turn back home right there and then\nAnd try to start a new life with the mother of my child\nI couldn't bear to hear those words again\nShe cried and said\nDaddy, don't you walk so fast\nMy daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast\nDaddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run\nOh, daddy, don't you walk so fast\n\n(Daddy, don't you walk so fast)\nMy daughter cried (Daddy, don't you walk so fast)\nDaddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run"
