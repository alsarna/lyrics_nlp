    "lyrics": "Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss? No no no\nBut when two eager lips\nAre pressed against yours\nYou'll know, yes, you'll know\n\nCan anyone explain the glow of romance? No no no\nBut when you hear the phrase\n\"It's you I adore\"\nYou'll know, yes, you'll know\n\nAnd you will find\nTo give love a start\nDon't think with your mind\nJust feel with your heart\n\nCan anyone explain the wonder of love? No no no\nBut now that you and I\nAre sharing a sigh\nWe know, yes, we know\n\nCan anyone explain the thrill of a kiss? No no no\nBut when two eager lips\nAre pressed against yours\nThen you'll know, yes, you'll know\n\nCan anyone explain the glow of romance? No no no\nBut when you hear the phrase\n\"It's you I adore\"\nThen you'll know, yes, you'll know, honey\nAnd you will find\nTo give love a start\nDon't think with your mind\nJust feel with your heart\n\nCan anyone explain the wonder of love? No no no\nBut now that you and I\nAre sharing a sigh\nWe know, you can't miss it, yes, we know"
