    "lyrics": "As I lie awake resting from the day\nI can hear the clock passing time away\nOh, I couldn't sleep, for on my mind\nWas the image of the girl I hope to find\n\nI look straight up at the ceiling above\nThinking of the girl whom I will love\nOh, would it be soon when she exists?\nThe image of the girl I've always wished\n\nI twisted and I turned, ooh, trying to sleep\nBut all I could do was only to weep\nFor I haven't found that image yet\nOf all the girls that I have met\n\nAnd now the clock is still passing time\nAnd I know someday that she will be mine\nAnd I know she'll always bring me love\nFor she's the image of the girl I love"
