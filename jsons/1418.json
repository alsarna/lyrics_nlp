    "lyrics": "I am the god of hellfire! And I bring you\nFire, I'll take you to burn\nFire, I'll take you to learn\nI'll see you burn\n\nYou fought hard and you saved and earned\nBut all of it's going to burn\nAnd your mind, your tiny mind\nYou know you've really been so blind\nNow's your time, burn your mind\nYou're falling far, too far behind\nOh no, oh no, oh no!\nYou're gonna burn\n\nFire, to destroy all you've done\nFire, to end all you've become\nI'll feel you burn\n\nYou've been living like a little girl\nIn the middle of your little world\nAnd your mind, your tiny mind\nYou know you've really been so blind\nNow's your time, burn your mind\nYou're falling far, too far behind\nOoh\nFire, I'll take you to burn\nFire, I'll take you to learn\nYou're gonna burn\nYou're gonna burn\nYou're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn\nBurn, burn, burn, burn\nBurn, burn, burn\n\nFire, I'll take you to burn\nFire, I'll take you to learn\nFire, I'll take you to bed\nFire, I'll take you, fire..."
