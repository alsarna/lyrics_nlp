    "lyrics": "Passionfruit & Loyalty by Drake & Kendrick Lamar ft. Rihanna LyricsTell me who you loyal to\nIs it money? is it fame? is it weed? is it drink?\nIs it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?\nBig chillin', only for the power in your name\nBaby, tell me who you loyal to\nIs it love for the streets when the lights get dark?\nIs it unconditional when the 'rari don't start?\nBaby, tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart yeah\n\nTell me who you loyal to\nDo it start with your woman or your man?\nDo it end with your family and friends?\nOr you're loyal to yourself in advance?\nI say, tell me who you loyal to\nIs it anybody that you would lie for?\nAnybody you would slide for?\nAnybody you would die for?\nThat's what god for\nBut listen, seeing you got ritualistic\nCleansin' my soul of addiction for now\nCause I'm fallin' apart\n\nTension, between us just like picket fences\nYou got issues that I won't mention for now\nCause we're fallin' apart\n\nPassionate from miles away\nPassive with the things you say\nPassin' up on my old ways\nI can't blame you, no, no\n\nPassionate from miles away\nPassive with the things you say\nPassin' up on my old ways\nI can't blame you, no, oh no, no\nI can't blame you no oh yeah\n\nHolla, holla! I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up\nAll I want tonight is just to get high up\nAll I want is loyalty, loyalty, loyalty (hey)\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty oh\n10-4, no switchin' sides\nFeel somethin' wrong\nYou actin' shifty, you don't ride\nWith me no more, I need\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty, yeah\nCause I'm\nPassionate from miles away\nPassive with the things you say\nPassin' up on my\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyalty\nLoyalty, loyalty, loyaltyEmbed"
