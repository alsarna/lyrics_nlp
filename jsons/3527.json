The crazy one!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI can't sleep at night, I toss and turn\nListening for the telephone\nBut when I get your call, I'm all choked up\nCan't believe you called my home\nAnd as a matter of fact, it blows my mind\nYou would even talk to me\nBecause a girl like you is like a dream come true\nA real life fantasy\n[Pre-Hook]\nNo matter what your friends try to tell you\nWe were made to fall in love\nAnd we will be together, any kind of weather\nIt's like that, it's like that\n\n[Hook]\nEvery little step I take, you will be there\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\nEvery little step I take, you will be there\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\n\n[Verse 1]\nI can't sleep at night, I toss and turn\nListening for the telephone\nBut when I get your call, I'm all choked up\nCan't believe you called my home\nAnd as a matter of fact, it blows my mind\nYou would even talk to me\nBecause a girl like you is like a dream come true\nA real life fantasy\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nNo matter what your friends try to tell you\nWe were made to fall in love\nAnd we will be together, any kind of weather\nIt's like that, it's like that girl\n[Hook]\nEvery little step I take, you will be there\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\nEvery little step I take, you will be there\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody wants to know what's going down\nNot with the James, not the Jim, but the Bobby Brown\nNow I'm chilling much harder as you all know\nCause Bobby Brown was good to good to good to go solo\nBeen on the microphone a long long time\nI'm guaranteed to bust a stupid rhyme\nNow I'm on the mic and I'm rocking real fresher\nEverybody out there don't talk less about me\nCause I'm rocking it steady\nAnd when I'm on the mic, don't you dare call me Freddy\nCause I'm ready to really get paid\nAnd if anybody steps in my way they getting slayed\nMy name is Brown, that's what they call me\nYes, I drive a 560 SEC\nAnd when I'm on the mic, you gotta see me\nDriving down the block cause I'm blocking and locking\nWhen the sucker M.C.'s trying to drop my spot\nWhen I'm rocking on the microphone\nPeople gotta gotta gotta gotta leave me alone\nCause I really don't care, really don't give a damn\nMy name is Bobby, and not Uncle Sam!\n[Bridge]\nShaba dootin ba\nShaba dootin bop shoo ba\nShaba dootin ba\nShaba dootin bop shoo ba\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nNo matter what your friends try to tell you\nWe were made to fall in love\nWe will always be together, any kind of weather\nIt's like that, it's like that girl!\n\n[Hook]\nEvery little step I take, you will be there (yeah yeah)\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\nEvery little step I take, you will be there (you'll be, you'll be there)\nEvery little step I make, we will be together12Embed"
