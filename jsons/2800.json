    "lyrics": "When I see you in the morning with the sleep still in your eyes\nI remember all the laughter and the tears we shared last night\nAnd as we lie here, just two shadows in the light before the dawn\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you\n\nAnd I have never been afraid of losing now\nAnd I have never wanted love to be a chain\nI only know that when I'm with you, you're my sunshine, you're my rain\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you\n\nNow, you and I, we're not children\nWe have both been loved before\nWe have given and we have taken many rides on troubled shores\nBut all the heartaches and temptations only make me love you more\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you\n\nAnd I have never been afraid of losing now\nAnd I have never wanted love to be a chain\nI only know that when I'm with you, you're my sunshine, you're my rain\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you"
