    "lyrics": "'My friends feel it's their appointed duty\nThey keep trying to tell me\nAll you want to do is use me\nBut my answer, yeah to all that use me stuff\nI want to spread the news\nThat if it feels this good getting used\nYou just keep on using me\nUntil you use me up\nUntil you use me up\nMy brother sit me right down and he talked to me\nHe told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me\nAnd I'm sure he meant well\nYeah, but when our talk was through\nI said, brother, if you only knew\nYou'd wish that you were in my shoes\nYou just keep on using me\nUntil you use me up\nUntil you use me up\nSometimes, it's true\nYou really do abuse me\nYou get me in a crowd of high-class people\nAnd then you act real rude to me\nBut, oh baby, baby, baby, baby\nWhen you love me, I can't get enough\nI want to spread the news\nThat if it feels this good getting used\nGirl, you just keep on using me\nUntil you use me up\nUntil you use me up\nTalkin' 'bout you usin' people\nIt all depends on what you do\nIt ain't too bad the way you're usin' me\nCause I sure am usin' you to do the things you do'\nTo do the things you do"
