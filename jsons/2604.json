    "lyrics": "Sexy Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI was sitting all alone, watching people getting off, with each other\nThey were dancing 'cross the floor, turning movement back and forth, they were lovers\nOne more lonely night for me, I looked up what did I see\n\n[Chorus]\nSexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes\nSexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music\nOoh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it\nNo more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be\n\n[Chorus]\nSexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes\nSexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes\nNo more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be\n\nSexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes\nSexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes\n\nSexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes\nSexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes3Embed"
