With you I'm born again\n\n[Verse 2: Syreeta]\nCome give me your sweetness\nNow there's you, there is no weakness\nLying safe within your arms, I'm born again\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Billy Preston & Syreeta]\nI was half, not whole\nIn step with none\nReaching through this world\nIn need of one\n\n[Chorus: Billy Preston & Syreeta]\nCome show me your kindness\nIn your arms I know I'll find this\nWoman, don't you know? With you I'm born again\nLying safe with you I'm born again\n\n[Verse 1: Billy Preston]\nCome bring me your softness\nComfort me through all this madness\nWoman, don't you know?
