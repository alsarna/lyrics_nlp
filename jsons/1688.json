    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEach day through my window I watch her as she passes by\nI say to myself, \"You're such a lucky guy\nTo have a girl like her is truly a dream come true\nOut of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you\"\n\n[Chorus]\nBut it was just my imagination, runnin' away with me\nIt was just my imagination runnin' away with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nSoon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)\nA cozy little home out in the country\nWith two children, maybe three\nI tell you I can visualize it all\nThis couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems\n\n[Chorus]\nBut it was just my imagination once again runnin' away with me\nTell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me\n\n[Bridge]\nEv'ry night on my knees I pray, Dear Lord, hear my plea\nDon't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die\nHer love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me\nI hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me\n[Chorus]\nJust my imagination once again runnin' away with me\nTell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me\nIâ€™ve never met her but I can't forget her\nJust my imagination once again runnin' away with me\nJust my imagination runnin' away with me"
