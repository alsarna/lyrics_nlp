    "lyrics": "I could never be loved by anyone sweeter than you\nAnd I could never belong to anyone sweeter than you\nWith you to stand beside me I'll never be alone\nAnd what more could I long for than to have you for my own\n\nMy only desire is loving you eternally\nFor no, no other love could ever mean so much to me\nSo if you say you love me forever I'll be true\nAnd what more could I long for than to live my life with you\n\nI could never be loved by anyone sweeter than you\nAnd I could never belong to anyone sweeter than you"
