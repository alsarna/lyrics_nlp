    "lyrics": "Ships LyricsWe walked to the sea\nJust my father and me\nAnd the dogs played around on the sand\nWinter cold cut the air\nHangin' still everywhere\nDressed in gray, did he say hold my hand\n\nI said, love's easier when it's far away\nWe sat and watched the distant light\n\nWe're two ships that pass in the night\nWe both smile and we say it's alright\nWe're still here, it's just that we're out of sight\nLike those ships that pass in the night\n\nThere's a boat on the line\nWhere the sea meets the sky\nThere's another that rides far behind\nAnd it seems you and I\nAre like strangers, a wide ways apart\nAs we drift on through time\nHe said, it's harder now, we're far away\nWe only read you when you write\n\nWe're two ships that pass in the night\nAnd we smile when we say it's alright\nWe're still here, it's just that we're out of sight\nLike those ships that pass in the night\n\nWe're just ships that pass in the night\nAnd we smile when we say it's alright\nWe're still here, it's just that we're out of sight\nLike those ships that pass in the nightEmbed"
