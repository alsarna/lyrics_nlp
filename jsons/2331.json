McVie]\nDon't stop thinking about tomorrow\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here\nIt'll be better than before\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone\n\n[Verse 3: Buckingham and C. McVie]\nAll I want is to see you smile\nIf it takes just a little while\nI know you don't believe that it's true\nI never meant any harm to you\n\n[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]\nDon't stop thinking about tomorrow\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here\nIt'll be better than before\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone\nDon't stop thinking about tomorrow\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here\nIt'll be better than before\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone\n\n[Outro: Buckingham and C. McVie]\nOoh, don't you look back\nOoh, don't you look back\nOoh, don't you look back\nOoh, don't you look back9Embed"
