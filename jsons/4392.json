    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEvery night in my dreams\nI see you, I feel you\nThat is how I know you go on\nFar across the distance\nAnd spaces between us\nYou have come to show you go on\n\n[Chorus]\nNear, far, wherever you are\nI believe that the heart does go on\nOnce more, you open the door\nAnd you're here in my heart\nAnd my heart will go on and on\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove can touch us one time\nAnd last for a lifetime\nAnd never let go 'til we're gone\nLove was when I loved you\nOne true time I'd hold to\nIn my life, we'll always go on\n\n[Chorus]\nNear, far, wherever you are\nI believe that the heart does go on\nOnce more, you open the door\nAnd you're here in my heart\nAnd my heart will go on and on\n[Outro]\nYou're here, there's nothing I fear\nAnd I know that my heart will go on\nWe'll stay forever this way\nYou are safe in my heart\nAnd my heart will go on and on"
