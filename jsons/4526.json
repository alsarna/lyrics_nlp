She's calling me\nBetween your legs, loud and clear\nI wanna talk back to her, make love to her\nI wanna hear you scream my name\n\n[Chorus]\nWe can make love in the bedroom\nFloating on top of my waterbed\nI'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair\nIn the hallway, making our way beside the stairs\nWe can do it anywhere\nI can love you in the shower, both of our bodies drippin' wet\nOn the patio, we can make a night you won't forget\nOn the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair\nWe can do it anywhere, anywhere\n[Verse 2]\nI love the way your body feels on top of mine\nSo take your time, we got a night\nGirl, you know, I like it slow\nAnd I know you like it too, baby\nPlease don't stop, I feel it now\nYou feel it too, you're shivering\nOoh, you put me close to you, just let it flow\nThere's no other place to go\n\n[Chorus]\nWe can make love in the bedroom\nFloating on top of my waterbed\nI'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair\nIn the hallway, making our way beside the stairs\nWe can do it anywhere\nI can love you in the shower, both of our bodies drippin' wet\nOn the patio, we can make a night you won't forget\nOn the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair\nWe can do it anywhere, anywhere\n\n[Verse 3: Lil' Zane]\nZ too hot to stop so we goin' from the bedroom to the floor\nLet you know a nigga miss you when out on tour\nWhen our tongues touch, have a playboy sing it much\nRoll a Dutch, let me tell you it turns me on\nWhen 112 sing to you, what kinda feeling do it bring to you?\nI bump hard 'til you say I'm being mean to you\nI know the ice Roley gleam to you\nA true player's what I seem to you\nAnd if you want it, we can do it in the Black 500 wit' the top down\nIn overdrive when we ride 'cause I'm hot now\nYou got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now\nZ feinin' like a criminal on lockdown\nSo let's get a way to get away\nYou gettin' hot, baby, please don't melt away\nI got a crib on the beach in Palmetto-way\nAnd here's your personal key to see me everyday, 112\n[Chorus]\nWe can make love in the bedroom\nFloating on top of my waterbed\nI'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair\nIn the hallway, making our way beside the stairs\nWe can do it anywhere\nI can love you in the shower, both of our bodies drippin' wet\nOn the patio, we can make a night you won't forget\nOn the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair\nWe can do it anywhere\n\n[Outro]\nWe can make love in the bedroom\nFloating on top of my waterbed\nI'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair\nIn the hallway, making our way beside the stairs\nWe can do it anywhere\nI can love you in the shower, both of our bodies drippin' wet\nOn the patio, we can make a night you won't forget\nOn the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair...2Embed"
