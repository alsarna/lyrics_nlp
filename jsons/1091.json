    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTrailer for sale or rent\nRooms to let, fifty cents\nNo phone, no pool, no pets\nI ain't got no cigarettes\n\nAh but two hours of pushing broom\nBuys a eight by twelve four-bit room\nI'm a man of means, by no means\nKing of the road\nThird boxcar, midnight train\nDestination: Bangor, Maine\nOld worn out suit and shoes\nI don't pay no union dues\nI smoke, old stogies I have found\nShort, but not too big around\nI'm a man of means, by no means\nKing of the road\n\nI know every engineer on every train\nAll of the children and all of their names\nEvery handout in every town\nEvery lock that ain't locked when no one's around\nI sing, trailers for sale or rent\nRooms to let, fifty cents\nNo phone, no pool, no pets\nI ain't got no cigarettes\nAh but, two hours of pushing broom\nBuys an eight by twelve four-bit room\nI'm a man of means, by no means\nKing of the road\n\nTrailer for sale or rent\nRooms to let, fifty cents\nNo phone, no pool, no pets\nI ain't got no cigarettes\n\nAh but, two hours of pushing broom\nBuys an eight by twelve four-bit room"
