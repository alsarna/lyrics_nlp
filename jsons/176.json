    "lyrics": "The naughty lady of Shady Lane\nHas hit the town like a bomb\nThe back-fence gossip ain't been this good\nSince Mabel ran off with Tom\nOur town was peaceful and quiet\nBefore she came on the scene\nThe lady has started a riot\nDisturbin' the suburban routine\n\n[Chorus:]\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane has the town in a whirl\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane\nMe-oh, my-oh, what a girl\nYou should see how she carries on\nWith her admirers galore\nShe must be givin' them quite a thrill\nThe way they flock to her door\nShe throws those come-hither glances\nAt every Tom, Dick, and Joe\nWhen offered some liquid refreshment\nThe lady never never says \"no\"\n\n[Chorus:]\nThe things they're trying to pin on her\nWon't hold much water, for sure\nBeneath the powder and fancy lace\nThere beats a heart sweet and pure\nShe just needs someone to change her\nAnd she'll be nice as can be\nIf you're in the neighborhood, stranger\nYou're welcome to drop in and see\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane\nSo delightful to hold\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane\nSo delectable\nQuite respectable\nAnd she's only nine days old"
