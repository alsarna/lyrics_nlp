    "lyrics": "The Big Hurt LyricsNow it begins, now that you've gone\nNeedles and pins, twilight till dawn\nWatching that clock till you return\nLighting that torch and watching it burn\n\nNow it begins, day after day\nThis is my night, ticking away\nWaiting to hear footsteps that say\n\"Love will appear and this time to stay\"\n\nOh, each time you go\nI try to pretend\nIt's over at last\nThis time the big hurt will end\n\nNow it begins, now that you've gone\nNeedles and pins, twilight till dawn\nBut if you go, come back again\nI wonder when, oh when will it end?\nThe big hurt\nThe big hurt\nThe big hurtEmbed"
