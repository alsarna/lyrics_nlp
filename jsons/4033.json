    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt\nI was unrecognizable to myself\nI saw my reflection in a window, I didn't know my own face\nOh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away\nOn the Streets of Philadelphia\n\n[Verse 2]\nI walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone\nI heard the voices of friends vanished and gone\nAt night I could hear the blood in my veins\nIt was just as black and whispering as the rain\nOn the Streets of Philadelphia\n\n[Bridge]\nAin't no angel gonna greet me\nIt's just you and I, my friend\nMy clothes don't fit me no more\nI walked a thousand miles\nJust to slip this skin\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake\nI can feel myself fading away\nSo receive me brother with your faithless kiss\nOr will we leave each other alone like this\nOn the Streets of Philadelphia"
