Yeah, yeah\nWell, I feel so broke up\nI wanna go home\n[Chorus: Whole Group]\nSo hoist up the John B's sail (Hoist up the John B's sail)\nSee how the mainsail sets (See how the mainsail sets)\nCall for the captain ashore, let me go home\nLet me go home, I wanna go home\nLet me go home (Hoist up the John B's sail)\nHoist up the John B (Hoist up the John B)\nI feel so broke up\nI wanna go home, let me go home\n\n[Verse 3: Brian Wilson, Mike Love]\nThe poor cook, he caught the fits\nAnd threw away all my grits\nAnd then he took and he ate up all of my corn\nLet me go home\nWhy don't they let me go home?\nThis is the worst trip I've ever been on\n\n[Chorus: All]\nSo hoist up the John B's sail (Hoist up the John B's sail)\nSee how the mainsail sets (See how the mainsail sets)\nCall for the captain ashore, let me go home\nLet me go home, I wanna go home\nLet me go home"
