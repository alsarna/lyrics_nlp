Uh-uh uh uh\n\nSome people have everything, and other people don't\nBut everything don't mean a thing if it ain't the thing you want\nExpress Yourself!\nExpress Yourself!\n\nOh, do it! Oh, do it\nDo it to it, go on and do it\nYo, do it, give\n\nExpress Yourself!\nExpress Yourself\n\nUh! [scatting]\n\nUh, express yourself, uh express yourself\nUh express yourself\nUh express yourself\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself\nExpress yourself"
