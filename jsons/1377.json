    "lyrics": "The old home town looks the same\nAs I step down from the train\nAnd there to meet me is my Mama and Papa\nDown the road I look and there runs Mary\nHair of gold and lips like cherries\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\nYes, they'll all come to meet me\nArms reaching, smiling sweetly\nIt's good to touch the green, green, grass of home\nThe old house is still standing\nTho' the paint is cracked and dry\nAnd there's that old oak tree that I used to play on\n\nDown the lane I walk with my sweet Mary\nHair of gold and lips like cherries\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\nYes, they'll all come to meet me\nArms reaching, smiling sweetly\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\n\n[Spoken:]\nThen I awake and look around me\nAt the four grey walls that surround me\nAnd I realize, yes, I was only dreaming\nFor there's a guard and there's a sad old padre -\nArm in arm we'll walk at daybreak\nAgain I touch the green, green grass of home\n\nYes, they'll all come to see me in the shade\nOf that old oak tree\nAs they lay me neath the green, green grass of home"
