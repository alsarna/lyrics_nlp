    "lyrics": "Take my hand\nI'm a stranger in Paradise\nAll lost in a wonderland\nA stranger in paradise\nIf I stand starry eyed\nThat's a danger in Paradise\nFor mortals who stand beside\nAn angel like you\nI saw your face\nAnd I ascended\nOut of the common place\nInto the rarest somewhere in space\nI hang suspended\nUntil I know\nThere's a chance that you care\nWon't you answer this fervent prayer?\nOf a stranger in paradise\nDon't send me in dark despair\nFrom all that I hunger for\nBut open your angel's arms\nTo this stranger in paradise\nAnd tell him that he need be\nA stranger no more"
