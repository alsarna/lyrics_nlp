Poku\nC'mon & get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you\nBreak it down\nSo many times I've been around you\nAnd I know how much I like you\nIt's like a dream each time I see you\nAnd there's this magic in the air\nI feel so shy that I can't approach you\nEven though you're just there\nBut I know that one day I'll get my way\nAnd this is what I'll say\nC'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you\nC'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you\nAnd in my dreams I am with you\nAnd I dance with your silhouette\nThere are many times I've tried to squeeze you\nIn these dreams I won't forget\nIt seems so long we've been together\nSince way back then\nAnd only if you knew how much I loved you\nYou'd turn to me and say.....\nLet's just say that our love is right\nWould you kiss and hold me tight\nCos I want to hold you and squeeze you\nAnd tell you that I love you\nEach and every night\nLet's just say that our love is strong\nWould you know were you belong\nOr would I have to show you and teach you\nHold you and please you to show you that you belong\nC'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you\nC'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you\nIf there's been a time that I needed you\nThen the time is now\nI want to see you every hour\nWhen I think I always hear you say....\nC'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you\nC'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you\nRepeat Rap.....\nChorus & fadeEmbed"
