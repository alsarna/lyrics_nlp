    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been looking at people and how they change with the times\nAnd lately all I've been seeing are people\nThrowing love away and losing their minds\n\nMaybe it's me who's gone crazy, but I can't understand why\nAll these lovers keep hurting each other\nWhen good love is so hard to come by\n\n[Chorus]\nSo what's the glory in living?\nDoesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?\nAnd if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I see love hungry people tryin' their best to survive\nWhen right there in their hands is a dying romance\nAnd they're not even trying to keep it alive\n\n[Chorus](x2)\nSo, what's the glory in living?\nDoesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?\nAnd if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?"
