    "lyrics": "A thousand times I’ve seen you standing\nGravity like a lunar landing\nMake me want to run till I find you\nI shut the world away from here\nDrift to you, you’re all I hear\nEverything we know fades to black\n\nHalf the time the world is ending\nTruth is I am done pretending\n\nI never thought that I had anymore to give\nPushing me so far\nHere I am without you\nDrink to all that we have lost\nMistakes we have made\nEverything will change\nBut love remains the same\n\nFind the place where we escape\nTake you with me for a space\nThe city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge\nI walk the streets through seven bars\nI had to find just where you are\nThe faces seem to blur, they’re all the same\n\nHalf the time the world is ending\nTruth is I am done pretending\nI never thought that I had anymore to give\nPushing me so far\nHere I am without you\nDrink to all that we have lost\nMistakes we have made\nEverything will change\nBut love remains the same\n\nSo much more to say\nSo much to be done\nDon’t you trick me out\nWe shall overcome\nSo all have stayed in place\nWe should have had the sun\nCould have been inside\nInstead we’re over here\n\nHalf the time the world is ending\nTruth is I am done pretending\nToo much time, too long defending\nYou and I are done pretending\n\nI never thought that I had anymore to give\nPushing me so far\nHere I am without you\nDrink to all that we have lost\nMistakes we have made\nEverything will change\nEverything will change\nI, oh I\nI wish this could last forever\nI, oh I\nAs if we could last forever\n\nLove remains the same\nLove remains the same"
