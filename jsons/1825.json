    "lyrics": "Garden Party Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends\nA chance to share old memories and play our songs again\nWhen I got to the garden party, they all knew my name\nNo one recognized me, I didn't look the same\n\n[Chorus]\nBut it's all right now, I learned my lesson well\nYou see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd people came from miles around, everyone was there\nYoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air\nAn' over in the corner, much to my surprise\nMr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nPlayed them all the old songs, thought that's why they came\nNo one heard the music, we didn't look the same\nI said, hello to \"Mary Lou\", she belongs to me\nWhen I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nSomeone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode\nPlaying guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should\nIf you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck\nBut if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck\n\n[Chorus 2x]4Embed"
