Bring us a dream\nGive him a pair of eyes with a come-hither gleam\nGive him a lonely heart like Pagliacci\nAnd lots of wavy hair like Liberace\n\n[Chorus 3]\nMr. Sandman, someone to hold (Someone to hold)\nWould be so peachy before we’re too old\nSo please turn on your magic beam\nMr Sandman, bring us, please, please, please\nMr Sandman, bring us a dream17Embed"
