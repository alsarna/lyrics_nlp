    "lyrics": "My father looked at me one day, said Son, it's plain to see\nThat you're getting older and should have a talk with me\nYou'll soon be going on lots of dates as to a man you grow\nAnd there's one important thing every boy should know\nAnd that is\nGirls, girls, girls were made to love\nGirls, girls, girls were made to love\nThat's why some have eyes of blue\nThat's why some stand five foot two\nCause girls, girls, girls were made to love\nOne day soon you'll have a date and you'll take her home that night\nThen you'll find you'll wonder Would a kiss be right?\nThe more you look, the more you'll find those doubts will fill your head\nBut think real hard and you might recall what your old Dad said\nHe said that\nGirls, girls, girls were made to love\nGirls, girls, girls were made to love\nThat's why ya watch em walk down the street\nThat's why their kisses taste awful sweet\nCause girls, girls, girls were made to love\nThen you'll meet that special girl wholl sweep your offa your feet\nYou'll want to say you love her but you'll find it hard to speak\nThis is a time when you'll find it's better left unsaid\nJust tell er like I've told your Mom, with a kiss instead\nGirls, girls, girls were made to love\nGirls, girls, girls were made to love\nThat's why ya watch em walk down the street\nThat's why their kisses taste awful sweet\nCause girls, girls, girls were made to love\nGirls, girls, girls were made to love"
