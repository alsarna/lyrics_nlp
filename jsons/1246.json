Ohh\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\nIt's just like me\nTo say to you\nLove me do\nAnd I'll be true\n\nAnd what I'd like\nFor you to say\nIs that you'll love me\nHere each day\nAhh, oh, ow!\n\nIt's just like me\nIt's just like me\nI act the fool\nThat's how I'll be\n\nBut it's just like you\nTo say goodbye\nAnd leave me alone\nAlone and cry\nIt's just like me\nIt's just like me\nIt's just like you...\nIt's just like you, ow!\nIt's just like me\nIt's just like me\nI want your love"
