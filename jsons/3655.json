    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI had it all but I let it slip away\nCouldn't see I treated you wrong\nNow I wander around\nFeeling down and cold\nTrying to believe that you're gone\n\n[Chorus]\nLove takes time\nTo heal when you're hurting so much\nCouldn't see that I was blind to let you go\nI can't escape the pain inside\nBecause love takes time\nI don't wanna be here\nI don't wanna be here alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nLosing my mind\nFrom this hollow in my heart\nSuddenly, I'm so incomplete\nLord, I need you now\nTell me how to stop the rain\nTears are falling down endlessly\n\n[Chorus]\nLove takes time\nTo heal when you're hurting so much\nCouldn't see that I was blind to let you go\nI can't escape the pain inside\nBecause love takes time\nI don't wanna be here\nI don't wanna be here alone\n[Bridge]\nYou might say that it's over\nYou might say that you don't care\nYou might say you don't miss me\nYou don't need me\nBut I know that you do\nAnd I feel that you do, inside\n\n[Chorus]\nLove takes time\nTo heal when you're hurting so much\nCouldn't see that I was so blind to let you go\nI can't escape the pain inside\nBecause love takes time\nI don't wanna be there\nI don't wanna be there alone"
