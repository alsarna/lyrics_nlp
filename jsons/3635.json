I never meant to cause you no pain\nAnd I realize I let you down, oh, yeah\nBut I know in my heart of hearts\nI know I'm never gonna hold you again, no no\n[Chorus]\nNow I... well now I know I wish it would rain down... down on me\nOh, you know I wish it would rain... rain down on me now\nOoh, yes, I wish it would rain down... down on me\nYes, you know I wish it would rain down... rain down over me\n\n[Outro]\nJust rain down over me\nJust let it rain down, let it rain down\nLet it rain down, oh, yeah\nLet it rain down, rain down over me\nJust let it rain down, just let it rain down\nLet it rain down\nJust let it rain"
