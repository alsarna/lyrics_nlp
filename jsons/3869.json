(Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)\n\n[Chorus]\nLook into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?\nWould I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)\nDon't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?\nWould I lie to you, baby, yeah?\n\n[Verse 1]\nEverybody wants to know the truth\nIn my arms is the only proof\nI've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door\nNow it's open, I can't do no more\n\n[PreChorus]\nI'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl\nIn this heart of mine (Oh-oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nLook into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?\nWould I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)\nDon't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?\nWould I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody's got their history (History)\nOn every page a mystery (It's a mystery, yeah)\nYou can read my diary, you're in every line\nJealous minds, never satisfied\n\n[PreChorus]\nI'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl\nIn this heart of mine (In this heart of mine)\n\n[Chorus]\nLook into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?\nWould I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)\nDon't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?\nWould I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)\n\n[Bridge]\n(Would I lie to you?) When you wanna see me night and day\n(Would I lie?) If I tell you that I'm here to stay\n(Would I lie to you?) Do you think I give my love away?\n(Would I lie?) That's not the kind of game I play\n\n[PreChorus]\nI'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl\nIn this heart of mine (In this heart of mine, deep in my heart)\nWhoo\n[Chorus]\nLook into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?\nWould I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)\nDon't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?\nWould I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)\n(Would I lie to you, baby?)\n\nLook into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?\nWould I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)\nDon't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?\nWould I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)\n(Come on, come on, come on, come on and kiss me, baby)\n\n(Look into my eyes)\n(Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)\nI wouldn't lie to you, baby, there ain't no one else but you"
