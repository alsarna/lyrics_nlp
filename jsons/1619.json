    "lyrics": "She ain't got no money\nHer clothes are kinda funny\nHer hair is kinda wild and free\nOh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes\nAnd nobody knows like me\nShe talks kinda lazy\nAnd people say she's crazy\nAnd her life's a mystery\nOh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes\nAnd nobody knows like me\n\nThere's something about her hand holding mine\nIt's a feeling that's fine\nAnd I just gotta say, hey!\nShe's really got a magical spell\nAnd it's working so well\nThat I can't get away\nI'm a lucky fella\nAnd I just got to tell her\nThat I love her endlessly\nBecause love grows where my Rosemary goes\nAnd nobody knows like me\n\nThere's something about her hand holding mine\nIt's a feeling that's fine\nAnd I just gotta say, hey!\nShe's really got a magical spell\nAnd it's working so well\nThat I can't get away\nI'm a lucky fella\nAnd I just got to tell her\nThat I love her endlessly\nBecause love grows where my Rosemary goes\nAnd nobody knows like me\n\nIt keeps growing every place she's been\nAnd nobody knows like me\nIf you've met her, you'll never forget her\nAnd nobody knows like me\nLa la la, believe it when you've seen it\nNobody knows like me"
