    "lyrics": "Perfect Way LyricsI took a backseat, a backhander, I took her back to her room\nI better get back to the basics for you, oh yeah\nYou gotta conscience, compassion, you got a way with the word\nYou gotta heart full of complacency too\n\nI don't have a purpose or mission, I'm empty by definition\nI got a lack girl that you'd love to be\nYou wanna diva a deduction, you wanna do what they do\nWanna do damage that you can undo\n\nApart from everyone away from your love\nA part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above\n\nI got a perfect way to make a new proposition\nI got a perfect way to make a justification\nI got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe\nI got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy\nI took a day job amendment, I took a liking to you\nI took a page out of my rulebook for you\nYou wanna message a confession, you wanna martyr me too\nYou wanna margin of error for two\n\nMaybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better\nI've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue\nI made an offer, an exception, I made a sense out of you\nYou took a good look at your book but I knew\n\nIn times of tenderness in terms baby so true\nUntil such time as I can understand all the things you do\n\nI got a perfect way to make a new proposition\nI got a perfect way to make a justification\nI got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe\nI got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy\n\nWant to forgive you for all the things that you do\nWanna forget how to remember with you\nMaybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better\nI've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue\n\nApart from everyone away from your love\nA part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above\nI got a perfect way to make a new proposition\nI got a perfect way to make a justification\nThis is a perfect way to make a certain a maybe\nIs this a perfect way to make the girls go crazy\n\nA perfect way\nA perfect way\nI got a perfect wayEmbed"
