    "lyrics": "There'll be no strings to bind your hands\nNot if my love can't bind your heart\nAnd there's no need to take a stand\nFor it was I who chose to start\nI see no reason to take me home\nI'm old enough to face the dawn\n\nJust call me angel of the morning, Angel\nJust touch my cheek before you leave me, baby\nJust call me angel of the morning, Angel\nThen slowly turn away... from me\n\nMaybe the sun's light will be dim\nAnd it won't matter anyhow\nIf morning's echo says we've sinned\nWell, it was what I wanted now\nAnd if we're the victims of the night\nI won't be blinded by light\n\nJust call me angel of the morning, Angel\nJust touch my cheek before you leave me, baby\nJust call me angel of the morning, Angel\nThen slowly turn away...\nI won't beg you to stay... with me...\nThrough the tears... of the day....\nOf the years... baby, baby --\nJust call me angel of the morning, Angel\nJust touch my cheek before you leave me, baby\nJust call me angel of the morning, Angel\nJust touch my cheek before you leave me, baby...."
