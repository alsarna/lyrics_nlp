    "lyrics": "I have often dreamed, of a far off place\nWhere a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me\nWhere the crowds will cheer, when they see my face\nAnd a voice keeps saying, \"This is where I'm meant to be\"\n\nI'll be there someday, I can go the distance\nI will find my way, if I can be strong\nI know every mile, will be worth my while\nWhen I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong\n\nDown an unknown road, to embrace my fate\nThough that road may wander, it will lead me to you\nAnd a thousand years, would be worth the wait\nIt might take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through\n\nAnd I won't look back, I can go the distance\nAnd I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat\nIt's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope\nTill I go the distance, and my journey is complete\n\nBut to look beyond the glory is the hardest part\nFor a hero's strength is measured by his heart\n\nLike a shooting star, I will go the distance\nI will search the world, I will face its harms\nI don't care how far, I can go the distance\nTill I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms\nI will search the world, I will face its harms\nTill I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms"
