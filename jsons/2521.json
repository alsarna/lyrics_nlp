    "lyrics": "Look around you, look up here\nTake time to make time, make time to be there\nLook around, be a part\nFeel for the winter, but don't have a cold heart\n\nAnd I love you best\nYou're not like the rest\nYou're there when I need you\nYou're there when I need\nI'm gonna need you\n\nA long time ago I had a lady to love\nShe made me think of things I never thought of\nNow she's gone and I'm on my own\nA love song has come into my mind\nA love song, it was there all the time\n\nSo lady, let me take a look at you now\nYou're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow\nOh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you\nDon't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do\n\nLook around, come to me\nI have no answers, but know where I wanna be\nI look around, play a part\nI was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart\nAnd I love you best\nYou're not like the rest\nYou're there when I need you\nYou're there when I need\nI'm gonna need you\n\nSo lady, let me take a look at you now\nYou're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow\nOh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you\nDon't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do\nDon't be thinkin' that I don't want you, lady I do"
