    "lyrics": "The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart\nHow white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart\n\nThere's a line between love and fascination\nThat's hard to see on an evening such as this\nFor they give the very same sensation\nWhen you are lost in the passion of a kiss\nYour lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart\n\nBut should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start\nFor this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart\nIt's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart"
