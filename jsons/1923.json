    "lyrics": "You're my love, you're my angel\nYou're the girl of my dreams\nI'd like to thank you\nFor waiting patiently\n\nDaddy's home\nYour daddy's home to stay\nHow I've waited for this moment\nTo be by your side\n\nYour best friend wrote and told me\nYou had teardrops in your eyes\nDaddy's home\nYour daddy's home to stay\n\nIt wasn't on a Sunday\n(Monday and Tuesday went by)\nIt wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon\n(All I could do was cry)\n\nBut I made a promise that you treasured\nI made it back home to you\nHow I've waited for this moment\nTo be by your side\nYour best friend wrote and told me\nYou had teardrops in your eyes\nDaddy's home\nYour daddy's home to stay\nDaddy's home to stay\nI'm not a thousand miles away\nDaddy's home to stay\nI'm gonna be here come what may\nDaddy's home to stay"
