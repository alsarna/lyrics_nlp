With your bad self!\n\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\n\n[Verse 1]\nSome people say we've got a lot of malice\nSome say it's a lot of nerve\nBut I say we won't quit moving until we get what we deserve\nWe have been 'buked and we have been scorned\nWe've been treated bad, talked about as sure as you're born\nBut just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair, ha\nBrother we can't quit until we get our share\n\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI worked on jobs with my feet and my hands\nBut all the work I did was for the other man\nNow we demand a chance to do things for ourselves\nWe're tired of beating our head against the wall\nAnd working for someone else\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh-wee, give it to me\nAll right, you're out of sight\nAll night, so tough\nYou're tough and rough\nOoh-wee, uh, you're killing me\n\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe demand a chance to do things for ourselves\nWe're tired of beating our head against the wall\nAnd working for someone else\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe're people, we like the birds and the bees\nWe'd rather die on our feet\nThan be living on our knees\n\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\n[Bridge 2]\nAll right now, good God\nYou know we can do the boogaloo\nNow we can say with the funky talk, and we do\nSometimes we sing and we talk\nYou know we jump back and do the camel walk\nAll right now, all right\nAll right\n\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe demand a chance to do things for ourselves\nWe're tired of beating our head against the wall\nAnd working for someone else\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe're people, we like the birds and the bees\nWe'd rather die on our feet\nThan be living on our knees\n\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\n[Bridge 3]\nOoh-wee, you're killing me\nAll right, you're out of sight\nAll right, you're out of sight\nOoh-wee, ah\nOoh-wee, you're killing me\nOoh-wee\n\n[Hook]\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!\nSay it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!"
