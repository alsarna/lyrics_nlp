    "lyrics": "Shower Me with Your Love LyricsMy heart is filled with so much love\nAnd I need someone I can call my own\nTo fall in love, that's what everyone's dreaming of\nI hold this feeling, oh, so strong\n\nLife is too short to live alone\nWithout someone to call my own\nI will care for you, you will care for me\nOur love will live forever\n\nShower me with your love\nShower me with the love that I long for\nShower me with your love\nShower me with the love I've been waiting for\n\nI close my eyes and pray all my wishes come true\nEvery night I go to sleep\nUntil you're mine, I'll wait for you endlessly\nCan't you see\nFairy tales, they do sometimes come true\nIf you believe, it could happen to you\nLike the stars that shine way up in the sky\nOur love will live forever\n\nShower me with your love\nShower me with the love that I long for\nShower me with your love\nShower me with the love I've been waiting for\n\nLike the stars that shine way up in the sky\nOur love will live forever\nLive forever\n\nShower me with your love\nShower me with the love that I long for\nShower me with your love\nShower me with the love I've been waiting for\n\nShower me with your love\nShower me with the love I've been waiting forEmbed"
