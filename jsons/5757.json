(Yeah)\nWho says you're not worth it? (Yeah, yeah)\nWho says you're the only one that's hurting?\nTrust me, that's the price of beauty (Hey, yeah, beauty)\nWho says you're not pretty? (Who said?)\nWho says you're not beautiful? (I'm just beautiful me)\nWho says?\n\n[Outro]\nWho says you're not perfect?\nWho says you're not worth it?\nWho says you're the only one that's hurting?\nTrust me, that's the price of beauty (Yeah)\nWho says you're not pretty? (Who says you're not beautiful?)\nWho says you're not beautiful?\nWho says?"
