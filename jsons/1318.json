    "lyrics": "If you don't love me\nWhy don't you tell me\nInstead of running around\nWith all the other guys in town\nCan't you see\nYou're hurting me\nDon't you care\nDon't you care\n\nIf you don't want me\nWhy don't you tell me\nInstead of telling lies\nAnd making me cry\nCan't you see\nYou're hurting me\nDon't you care\nDon't you care\n\nWhatever happened\nTo all the good times we used to have\nThe times we cried and laughed\nI want to know, I want to know\nWill you ever love me again\nOr will I find out that this is the end\nDon't you care\nMy my my my baby\nYou said that you'd believe me\nThen why'd you ever leave me\nI'm standing here all alone\nWithout a girl of my own\nCan't you see\nYou're hurting me\nDon't you care\nDon't you care\n\nDon't you care\nDon't you care\nDon't you care\nDon't you care\nDon't you care\nDon't you care"
