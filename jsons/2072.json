    "lyrics": "Wildwood Weed LyricsThe name of this song is the Wildwood Flower\nNow the Wildwood Flower is an old country classic\nIt's gained a whole new popularity\nThe song isn't any more popular\nBut the flower is doin' real good\n\nThe wildwood flower grew wild on the farm\nAnd we never knowed what it was called\nSome said it was a flower and some said it was a weed\nI didn't give it much thought\nOne day I was out there talking to my brother\nAnd I reached down for a weed to chew on\nThings got fuzzy and things got blurry\nAnd then everything was gone!\nDidn't know what happened\nBut I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin' burlap\nI come to and my brother was there\nAnd he said, \"What's wrong with your eyes?\"\nI said, \"I don't know, I was chewing on a weed\"\nHe said, \"Let me give it a try\"\nWe spent the rest of that day and most of that night\nTrying to find my brother, Bill\nCaught up with him, 'bout six o'clock the next morning\nNaked, singing on the wind mill!\nHe said he flew up there\nI had to fly up there and bring him down\nHe was about half crazy\n\nThe very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds\nAnd put 'em in the sun to dry\nThen we mashed 'em up and chopped 'em up\nAnd put 'em in the corncob pipe\nSmokin' that wildwood flower got to be a habit\nWe didn't see no harm\nWe thought it was kind of handy\nTake a trip and never leave the farm!\nBig 'ole puff of that wildwood weed next thing you know\nYou're just wand'ring 'round behind the little animals\n\nAll good things gotta come to an end\nAnd it's the same with the wildwood weed\nOne day this feller from Washington came by\nAnd he spied it and turned white as a sheet\nThen they dug and they burned\nAnd they burned and they dug\nAnd they killed all our cute little weeds\nThen they drove away\nWe just smiled and waved\nSittin' there on that sack of seeds!\n\"Y'all come back now, ya hear?\"Embed"
