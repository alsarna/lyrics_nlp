My Papa LyricsOh, my pa-pa, to me he was so wonderful\nOh, my pa-pa, to me he was so good\nNo one could be, so gentle and so lovable\nOh, my pa-pa, he always understood\n\nGone are the days when he could take me on his knee\nAnd with a smile he'd change my tears to laughter\n\nOh, my pa-pa, so funny, so adorable\nAlways the clown, so funny in his ways\nOh, my pa-pa, to me he was so wonderful\nDeep in my heart I miss him so today\n\nGone are the days when he could take me on his knee\nAnd with a smile he'd change my tears to laughter\nOh, my pa-pa, to me he was so wonderful\nDeep in my heart I miss him so today\nOh, my pa-pa\nOh, my pa-paEmbed"
