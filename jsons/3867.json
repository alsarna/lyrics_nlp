(What about your friends?)\nWill they stand their ground?\nWill they let you down again? (Woah)\nWhat about your friends? (What about your friends?)\nAre they gonna be low down (Be low down)\nWill they ever be around? (Be around)\nOr will they turn their backs on you?\nWhat about your friends? (What about your friends?)\nWill they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)\nWill they let you down again? (Oh)\nWhat about your friends? (What about your friends?)\nAre they gonna be low down (Be low down)\nWill they ever be around? (Be around)\nOr will they turn their backs on you?\n[Refrain: Left Eye]\nYo, is it me? Here we go\nOr can it be I am a little too friendly?\nSo to speak hypothetically say?\nI supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate\nOnly to make an enemy, which results in unfortunate destiny\nThey dog me out then be next to me\nJust cause I am what some choose to envy\n\n[Chorus: All]\nWhat about your friends?\nWill they stand their ground?\nWill they let you down again?\nWhat about your friends? (What about your friends?)\nAre they gonna be low down?\nWill they ever be around? (Be around)\nOr will they turn their backs on you?\nWhat about your friends?\nWill they stand their ground?\nWill they let you down again?\nWhat about your friends? (What about your friends?)\nAre they gonna be low down? (Be low down)\nWill they ever be around? (Be around)\nOr will they turn their backs on you?\n\n[Bridge: Chilli]\nPeople say I act a little funny\nI wouldn't change not for no money\nI'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me\nYeah, yeah (What about your friends?)\nEven though I might be easy\nIt don't give you no cause to deceive me\nIt's not the way that I want my friends to ever be\n[Chorus: All]\nWhat about your friends?\nWill they stand their ground?\nWill they let you down again?\nWhat about your friends? (What about your friends?)\nAre they gonna be low down? (Be low down)\nWill they ever be around? (Will they ever be around)\nOr will they turn their backs on you? (Or will they turn their backs on you?)\nWhat about your friends?\nWill they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)\nWill they let you down again?\nWhat about your friends?"
