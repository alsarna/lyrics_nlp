    "lyrics": "Comin' on strong, comin' on strong\nI can feel the heartaches\nComin' on strong\nI can feel the teardrops, the pain, and the sorrow\nEver since you've been gone, they' been\nComin' on strong\n\nPain, come on in, hello sorrow\nI see you're back again\nTeardrops, glad you dropped by\n'Cause you can help drown my pride\n\nAnd since you're here, time seems just fine\nTo let you know that you're gonna be with me\n'Til I lose my mind\nBut you've been gone\nMuch too long and I can feel the heartaches\nComin' on strong\n\nOnly thing you left me, was misery for company\nAnd memories of a love gone wrong, that keep\nComin' on strong. Comin' on strong\nComin' on strong. Comin' on strong\nComin' on strong. Comin' on strong"
