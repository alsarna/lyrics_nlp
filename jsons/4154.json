    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nYou and I\nIn this moment\nHolding the night so close\n\nHanging on\nStill unbroken\nWhile outside the thunder rolls\n\n[Chorus:]\nListen now\nYou can hear our heartbeat\nWarm against life's bitter cold\nThese are the days\nThe sweetest days we'll know\n\n[Verse 2:]\nThere are times that scare me\nWere rattle the house like a wind\nBoth of ours so unbending\nWe battle the fear within\n\n[Chorus:]\nAll the while\nLife is rushing by us\nHold it now and don't let go\nThese are the days\nThe sweetest days we'll know\n[Bridge:]\nSo we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness\nWatching the stars\nTill they're gone\nAnd then even the memories have all faded away\nThese days go on and on\n\n[Chorus:]\nListen now\nYou can hear our heartbeat\nHold me now and don't let go\nThese are the days\nEvery day is the sweetest day we'll know\n\nThese are the days\nThe sweetest days we'll know"
