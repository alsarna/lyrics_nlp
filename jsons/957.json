    "lyrics": "They say that you're a runaround lover\nThough you say it isn't so\nBut if you put me down for another\nI'll know, believe me, I'll know\n\n'Cause the night has a thousand eyes\nAnd a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me\nSo remember when you tell those little white lies\nThat the night has a thousand eyes\n\nYou say that you're at home when you phone me\nAnd how much you really care\nThough you keep telling me that you're lonely\nI'll know if someone is there\n\n'Cause the night has a thousand eyes\nAnd a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me\nSo remember when you tell those little white lies\nThat the night has a thousand eyes\n\nOne of these days you're gonna be sorry\n'Cause your game I'm gonna play\nAnd you'll find out without really tryin'\nEach time that my kisses stray\n\n'Cause the night has a thousand eyes\nAnd a thousand eyes will see me too\nAnd no matter what I do\nI could never disguise all my little white lies\n'Cause the night has a thousand eyes\nSo remember when you tell those little white lies\nThat the night has a thousand eyes"
