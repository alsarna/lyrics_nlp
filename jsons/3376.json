    "lyrics": "Oooh, oo oooh, cha\nCatch my breath, close my eyes\nDon't believe a word\nThings she said, overheard\nSomething wrong inside\nHits you in a minute, oooh\nThen you know you're in it, aah\n\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\nThe hardest part is when you're in it\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\n\nJust one touch, just one look\nA dangerous dance\nOne small word can make me feel\nLike running away\nYou can't say you're in it, no, until you reach the limit\n\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\nThe hardest part is when you're in it\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\nThe hardest part is when you're in it\nI've been in love before\nI've been in love before\n\nI've been in love\nThe hardest part is when you're in it\nI've been in love\nI've been in love before"
