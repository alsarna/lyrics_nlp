More than a lot\nYou gave me nothing, now it's all I got\nWe're one, but we're not the same\nWell, we hurt each other, then we do it again\n\n[Bridge]\nYou say love is a temple, love a higher law\nLove is a temple, love the higher law\nYou ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl\nAnd I can't be holding on to what you got\nWhen all you got is hurt\n\n[Chorus]\nOne love, one blood\nOne life, you got to do what you should\nOne life with each other\nSisters, brothers\nOne life, but we're not the same\nWe get to carry each other, carry each other\nOne\nOne\n\n[Outro]\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOh-ooh\nMay we, may we, may we get\nHigher\nOh, higher\n(Ay, yeah, go) higher\n(Oh) Higher"
