    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe dawn is breaking\nA light shining through\nYou're barely waking\nAnd I'm tangled up in you, yeah\nI'm open, you're closed\nWhere I follow, you'll go\nI worry I won't see your face\nLight up again\n\n[Chorus]\nEven the best fall down sometimes\nEven the wrong words seem to rhyme\nOut of the doubt that fills my mind\nI somehow find you and I collide\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm quiet you know\nYou make a first impression\nI've found I'm scared to know\nI'm always on your mind\n\n[Chorus]\nEven the best fall down sometimes\nEven the stars refuse to shine\nOut of the back you fall in time\nI somehow find you and I collide\n[Bridge]\nDon't stop here\nI lost my place\nI'm close behind\n\n[Chorus]\nEven the best fall down sometimes\nEven the wrong words seem to rhyme\nOut of the doubt that fills your mind\nYou finally find you and I collide\n\n[Outro]\nYou finally find you and I collide\nYou finally find you and I collide"
