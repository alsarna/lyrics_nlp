    "lyrics": "Third Rate Romance LyricsSitting at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant\nShe was staring at her coffee cup\nHe was trying to keep his courage up by applying booze\nTalk was small when they talked at all, they both knew what they wanted\nThere was no need to talk about it\nThey were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose\n\nShe said, you don't look like my type, but I guess you'll do\nThird rate romance, low rent rendezvous\nHe said, I'll even tell you that I love you, if you want me too\nThird rate romance, low rent rendezvous\n\nWhen they left the bar, they got in his car and they drove away\nHe drove to the family inn\nShe didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for\nThen he went to the desk and made his request while she waited outside\nAnd he came back with the key\nAnd she said, give it to me and I'll unlock the door\nShe kept saying, I've never really done this kind of thing before, have you\nThird rate romance, low rent rendezvous\nAnd he said, yes I have, but only a time or two\nThird rate romance, low rent rendezvous\nThird rate romance, low rent rendezvous\nThird rate romance, low rent rendezvousEmbed"
