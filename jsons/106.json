    "lyrics": "Tell Me Youre Mine LyricsOh my wonderful one\nHow I adore you\nThrough the day and the night\nI'm longing for you\nWon't you tell me you care\nOh I implore you\nWhile the stars above shine\nOh a new world I'll find\nIf you'll tell me you're mine\nOh how I wanted to tell you my dear\nJust what was in my heart\nRepeat the first verseEmbed"
