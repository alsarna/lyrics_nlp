Sweet child o' mine\nWoah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine\n[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 2]\nShe's got eyes of the bluest skies\nAs if they thought of rain\nI hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain\nHer hair reminds me of a warm, safe place\nWhere as a child I'd hide\nAnd pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by\n\n[Chorus]\nWoah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine\nOoh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine\n[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nOh yeah! Woah-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine\nOoh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine\nWoah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah\nOoh! Sweet love of mine\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nWhere do we go?\nWhere do we go now?\nWhere do we go?\nOoh, where do we go?\nWhere do we go now?\nOh, where do we go now?\nWhere do we go? (Sweet child...)\nOoh, where do we go now?\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nWhere do we go now? Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wow\nWhere do we go?\nOh, where do we go now?\nOh, where do we go?\nWhere do we go now?\nWhere do we go?\nOoh, where do we go now?\nNow, now, now, now, now, now, now\nSweet child, sweet child o' mine75Embed"
