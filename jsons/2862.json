    "lyrics": "Any day now\nI will hear you say\nGood bye, my love\nAnd you'll be on your way\nThen my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown\nAny day now, I'll be all alone\n\nAny day now\nWhen your restless eyes meets someone new\nOh, to my sad surprise\nThen blue shadows will fall all over town\nAny day now, love will let me down\n\nI know I shouldn't want to keep you\nIf you don't want to stay\nUntil you're gone forever\nI'll keep holding on for dear life\n\nHolding you this way\nBegging you to stay\nAny day now, when the clock strikes go\nYou'll call it off\nThen my tears will flow\n\nThen my wild beautiful bird\nYou will have flown\nAny day now, love will let me down\nCause you won't be around\nOh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town\nAny day now\nLove will let me down\nCause you won't be around\nAny day now\nYou won't be around\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around"
