    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe both lie silently still in the dead of the night\nAlthough we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside\nWas it something I said or something I did?\nDid my words not come out right?\nThough I tried not to hurt you\nThough I tried\nBut I guess that's why they say\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery rose has its thorn\nJust like every night has its dawn\nJust like every cowboy sings a sad sad song\nEvery rose has its thorn\n\nYeah it does\n\n[Verse 2]\nI listen to our favorite song playing on the radio\nHear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go\nBut I wonder does he know\nHas he ever felt like this\nAnd I know that you'd be here right now\nIf I could have let you know somehow\nI guess\n[Chorus]\nEvery rose has its thorn\nJust like every night has its dawn\nJust like every cowboy sings a sad sad song\nEvery rose has its thorn\n\n[Bridge]\nThough it's been a while now\nI can still feel so much pain\nLike a knife that cuts you the wound heals\nBut the scar, that scar remains\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know I could have saved a love that night\nIf I'd known what to say\nInstead of makin' love\nWe both made our separate ways\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd now I hear you found somebody new\nAnd that I never meant that much to you\nTo hear that tears me up inside\nAnd to see you cuts me like a knife\nI guess\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery rose has its thorn\nJust like every night has its dawn\nJust like every cowboy sings a sad sad song\nEvery rose has its thorn"
