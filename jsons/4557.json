Sharon, I love you!\n\n[Verse 2: Sharon]\nI was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street\nL-A-T-E-R that week\nMy sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats\nAn incredible eight-foot heap\nNow the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat\nInvolved an under usual feat\nAnd I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come\nSo I missed a million miles of fun\n\n[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]\nI know it's up for me\n(If you steal my sunshine)\nMaking sure I'm not in too deep\n(If you steal my sunshine)\nKeeping versed and on my feet\n(If you steal my sunshine)\n[Chorus 2: Marc & (Sharon)]\nI know it's done for me\n(If you steal my sunshine)\nNot some and hard to see\n(If you steal my sunshine)\nKeeping dumb and built to beat\n(If you steal my sunshine)\n\n[Outro: Marc & Sharon]\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine\nMy sunshine, if you steal my sunshine"
