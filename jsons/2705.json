    "lyrics": "Love on the rocks, ain't no surprise\nJust pour me a drink and I'll tell you some lies\nGot nothing to lose, so you just sing the blues\nAll the time\n\nGave you my heart, gave you my soul\nYou left me alone here with nothing to hold\nYesterday's gone, now all I want\nIs a smile\n\nFirst they say they want you, indeed how they really need you\nSuddenly you find you're out there walking in a storm\nAnd when they know they have you then they really have you\nNothing you can do or say, you've got to leave, just get away\nWe all know the song\n\nYou need what you need, you can say what you want\nNot much you can do when the feeling is gone\nMaybe blue skies above, but it's cool\nWhen your love's on the rocks\n\nFirst they say they want you, indeed how they really need you\nSuddenly you find you're out there walking in a storm\nAnd when they know they have you then they really have you\nNothing you can do or say, you've got to leave, just get away\nWe all know the song\nLove on the rocks, ain't no big surprise\nJust pour me a drink and I'll tell you my lies\nYesterday's gone, now all I want\nIs a smile"
