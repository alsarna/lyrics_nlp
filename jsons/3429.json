Lyrics[Verse 1: Neil Tennant, Dusty Springfield & Both]\nYou always wanted a lover\nI only wanted a job\nI've always worked for my living\nHow am I gonna get through?\nHow am I gonna get through?\n\n[Verse 2: Neil Tennant, Dusty Springfield & Both]\nI come here looking for money\nGot to have it\nAnd end up living with love, oh, oh\nNow you left me with nothing\nCan't take it\nHow am I gonna get through?\nHow am I gonna get through?\n[Pre-Chorus: Neil Tennant]\nI bought you drinks, I brought you flowers\nI read your books and talked for hours\nEvery day, so many drinks\nSuch pretty flowers, so tell me\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I\n\n[Chorus: Dusty Springfield, Neil Tennant & Both]\nSince you went away I've been hanging around\nI've been wondering why I'm feeling down\nYou went away, it should make me feel better\nBut I don't know, oh\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\n\n[Verse 3: Neil Tennant, Dusty Springfield & Both]\nYou always wanted me to be something I wasn't\nYou always wanted too much, oh, oh\nNow I can do what I want to, forever\nHow am I gonna get through?\nHow am I gonna get through?\n[Pre-Chorus: Neil Tennant]\nAt night, the people come and go\nThey talk too fast and walk too slow\nChasing time from hour to hour\nI pour the drinks and crush the flowers\nWhat have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I\n\n[Chorus: Dusty Springfield, Neil Tennant & Both]\nSince you went away I've been hanging around\nI've been wondering why I'm feeling down\nYou went away, it should make me feel better\nBut I don't know, oh\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nBaby\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nBaby\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nBaby\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nTell me\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nBaby\nHow I'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nYeah\n[Outro: Dusty Springfield & Neil Tennant]\nI'm gonna get through\nI'm gonna get through\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nI'm gonna get through, right?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWe don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWe don't need to go to hell and back every night\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWe can make a deal\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWe don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWe don't need to go to hell and back every night\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?\nWhat have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?2Embed"
