There's no way that this thing is through\nNo, no.  (I still can't get over loving you.)\nNot yet, I ain't through loving you\nI'm getting mad, girl.  (Loving you.)\nDon't you even try to leave, no, no\n(I still can't get over loving you.) 'Cause it'll be the last thing you'll ever do\nOw!\nLoving you.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\nI still can't get over loving you\nLoving you\nI still can't get over loving youEmbed"
