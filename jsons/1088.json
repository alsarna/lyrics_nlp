    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou saw me crying in the chapel\nThe tears I shed were tears of joy\nI know the meaning of contentment\nNow I am happy with the Lord\n\nJust a plain and simple chapel\nWhere humble people go to pray\nI pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger\nAs I live from day to day\n\n[Chorus]\nI've searched and I've searched\nBut I couldn't find\nNo way on earth\nTo gain peace of mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm happy in the chapel\nWhere people are of one accord\nWe gather in the chapel\nJust to sing and praise the Lord\n\nYou'll searched and you'll searched\nBut you couldn't find\nNo way on earth\nTo gain peace of mind\n[Verse 3]\nTake your troubles to the chapel\nGet down on your knees and pray\nYour burdens will be lighter\nAnd you'll surely find the way"
