(Telling me lies)\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember?... (Do you remember?)\nUh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere seemed no way to make up\n'Cause it seemed your mind was set\nAnd the way you looked it told me\nIt's a look I know I'll never forget\nYou could've come over to my side\nYou could've let me know\nYou could've tried to see the distance between us\nBut it seemed too far for you to go\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember?... (Do you remember?)\nUh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)\n[Verse 3]\nThrough all of my life\nIn spite of all the pain\nYou know people are funny sometimes\n'Cause they just can't wait\nTo get hurt again\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)\n\n[Verse 4]\nThere are things we won't recall\nAnd feelings we'll never find\nIt's taken so long to see it\n'Cause we never seemed to have the time\n\nThere was always something more important to do\nMore important to say\nBut \"I love you\" wasn't one of those things\nAnd now it's too late\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)\nUh, do you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)\nUh, yeah\nTell me, do you rememeber?... (Do you remember? Now it's over)\nDo you remember? (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)\nTell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Now it's over)\nTell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)\nDo you remember?..."
