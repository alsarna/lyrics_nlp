Okay, let me try that again\n\n[Verse 1]\nMade a wrong turn, once or twice\nDug my way out, blood and fire\nBad decisions, that's alright\nWelcome to my silly life\nMistreated, misplaced, misunderstood\nMiss “Knowing it's all good”\nIt didn’t slow me down\nMistaken, always second guessing\nUnderestimated\nLook, I'm still around\n\n[Chorus]\nPretty, pretty please\nDon't you ever, ever feel\nLike you're less than, less than perfect\nPretty, pretty please\nDon't you ever ever feel\nLike you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou’re so mean (You’re so mean)\nWhen you talk (When you talk)\nAbout yourself, you were wrong\nChange the voices (Change the voices)\nIn your head (In your head)\nMake them like you instead\nSo complicated, look how we all make it\nFilled with so much hatred, such a tired game\nIt's enough, I’ve done all I can think of\nChased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh\n[Chorus]\nPretty, pretty please\nDon't you ever, ever feel\nLike you're less than, less than perfect\nPretty, pretty please\nDon’t you ever ever feel\nLike you're nothing, you are perfect to me\n\n[Bridge]\nThe whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear\nThe only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer\nSo cool in line, and we try, try, try\nBut we try too hard, it's a waste of my time\nDone looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere\nThey don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair\nExchange ourselves and we do it all the time\nWhy do we do that?\nWhy do I do that?\n\n[Chorus]\nYes, you're perfect to me\nPretty, pretty please\nDon't you ever, ever feel\nLike you're less than, less than perfect\nPretty, pretty please\nIf you ever, ever feel\nLike you're nothing, you are perfect to me, yes\nWe're perfect, oh, we're perfect to me\nPretty, pretty please\nIf you ever, ever feel\nLike you're nothing, you are perfect to me"
