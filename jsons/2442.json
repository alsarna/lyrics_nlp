    "lyrics": "You Needed Me LyricsI cried a tear, you wiped it dry\nI was confused, you cleared my mind\nI sold my soul, you bought it back for me\nAnd held me up and gave me dignity\nSomehow you needed me\n\nYou gave me strength to stand alone again\nTo face the world out on my own again\nYou put me high upon a pedestal\nSo high that I could almost see eternity\nYou needed me, you needed me\n\nAnd I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true\nI needed you and you were there\nAnd I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool\n'Cause I finally found someone who really cares\nYou held my hand when it was cold\nWhen I was lost, you took me home\nYou gave me hope when I was at the end\nAnd turned my lies back into truth again\nYou even called me friend\n\nYou gave me strength to stand alone again\nTo face the world out on my own again\nYou put me high upon a pedestal\nSo high that I could almost see eternity\nYou needed me, you needed me\nYou needed me, you needed meEmbed"
