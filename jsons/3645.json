    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWords like violence break the silence\nCome crashing in into my little world\nPainful to me, pierce right through me\nCan't you understand? Oh, my little girl\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed is here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 2]\nVows are spoken to be broken\nFeelings are intense, words are trivial\nPleasures remain, so does the pain\nWords are meaningless and forgettable\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed is here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\n[Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed is here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed is here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Outro]\nEnjoy the silence"
