    "lyrics": "Kiss And Say Goodbye Lyrics[Intro: Winifred Lovett]\nThis has got to be the saddest day of my life\nI called you here today for a bit of bad news\nI won't be able to see you anymore\nBecause of my obligations and the ties that you have\nWe've been meeting here every day\nAnd since this is our last day together\nI wanna hold you just one more time\nWhen you turn and walk away, don't look back\nI wanna remember you just like this\nLet's just kiss and say goodbye\n\n[Verse 1: Gerald Alston]\nI had to meet you here today\nThere's just so many things to say\nPlease don't stop me till I'm through\nThis is somethin' I hate to do\n[Chorus 1: Gerald Alston]\nWe've been meeting here so long\nI guess what we done, oh was wrong\nPlease darlin', don't you cry\nLet's just kiss and say goodbye\n\n[Verse 2: Gerald Alston]\nMany months have passed us by\nI'm gonna miss you, I can't lie\nI've got ties and so do you\nI just think this is the thing to do\n\n[Chorus 2: Gerald Alston]\nIt's gonna hurt me, I can't lie\nMaybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy\nUnderstand me, oh won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try?\nLet's just kiss an' say goodbye\n\n[Outro: Gerald Alston]\nI'm gonna miss you, I can't lie\nUnderstand me, oh won't you try?\nIt's gonna hurt me, I can't lie\nTake my handkerchief an' wipe your eyes\nMaybe you'll find, you'll find another guy\nWell let's kiss and say goodbye, pretty baby\nPlease, don't you cry\nUnderstand me, oh won't you try?\nLet's just kiss and say goodbye3Embed"
