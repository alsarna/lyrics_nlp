    "lyrics": "(from the musical \"The Pajama Game\" by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross)\n\nI know a dark secluded place\nA place where no one knows your face\nA glass of wine, a fast embrace\nIt's called Hernando's Hideaway\nOle!\n\nAnd all you'll see are silhouettes\nAnd all you'll hear are castanets\nAnd no one cares how late it gets\nNot at Hernando's Hideaway\nOle!\n\nAt the Golden Fingerbowl or any place you go\nYou will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know\nBut if you'll go the spot that I am thinkin' of\nYou will be free to gaze at me and talk of love\n\nJust knock three times and whisper low\nThat you and I were sent by Joe\nThen strike a match and you will know\nYou're in Hernando's Hideaway\nOle!\n\nJust knock three times and whisper low\nThat you and I were sent by Joe\nThen strike a match and you will know\nYou're in Hernando's Hideaway"
