    "lyrics": "Wedding Song (There Is Love) LyricsHe is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts;\nRest assured, this troubadour is acting on His part\nThe union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain\nFor whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name there is love, there is love\n\nWell a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home;\nThey shall travel on to where the two shall be as one;\nAs it was in the beginning is now and 'til the end\nWoman draws her life from man and gives it back again, and there is love, there is love\n\nWell then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife?\nIs it love that brings you here or love that brings you life?\nOr if loving is the answer, then who's the giving for?\nDo you believe in something that you've never seen before?\n\nOh there's love, oh there's love\nOh the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain\nFor whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name there is love, oh there's loveEmbed"
