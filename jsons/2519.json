    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOn a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere\nI met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep\nSo we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness\n'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe said, \"Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces\nAnd knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes\nSo if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces\nFor a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow\nThen he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light\nAnd the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression\nSaid, \"If you're gonna play the game, boy\nYou gotta learn to play it right\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em\nKnow when to walk away and know when to run\nYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table\nThere'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done\n\n[Verse 4]\nEvery gambler knows that the secret to survivin'\nIs knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep\n'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser\nAnd the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep\n[Verse 5]\nAnd when he finished speakin'\nHe turned back towards the window\nCrushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep\nAnd somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even\nBut in his final words I found an ace that I could keep\n\n[Chorus]\nYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em\nKnow when to walk away and know when to run\nYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table\nThere'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done\n\n[Outro]\nYou got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)\nKnow when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)\nKnow when to walk away and know when to run\nYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table\nThere'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done\nYou got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em\nKnow when to walk away and know when to run\nYou never count your money when you're sittin' at the table\nThere'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done"
