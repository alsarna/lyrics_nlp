    "lyrics": "Do you wanna dance, and hold my hand?\nTell me you're my lover man\nOh baby, do you wanna dance?\n\nWe could dance under the moonlight\nHug and kiss all through the night\nOh baby, tell me, do you wanna dance with me baby?\n\nDo you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?\nDo you, do you, do you want to dance?\nDo you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me baby?\n\nAh, that's right, ah, ah, aaaaaaaah\nDo you want to dance under the moonlight?\nHug me, kiss me, baby, all through the night\nOh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me, do you want to dance?\n\nOh, do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?\nDo you want to dance?\nDo you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me baby?\nYou got to dance with me baby\nPlease dance with me baby"
