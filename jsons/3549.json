    "lyrics": "Girl, you're looking fine tonight\nAnd every guy has got you in his sight\nWhat you're doing with a clown like me\nIs surely one of life's little mysteries\n\nSo tonight I'll ask the stars above\n\"How did I ever win your love?\"\nWhat did I do?\nWhat did I say\nTo turn your angel eyes my way?\n\nWell, I'm the guy who never learned to dance\nNever even got one second glance\nAcross a crowded room was close enough\nI could look but I could never touch\n\nSo tonight I'll ask, the stars above\n\"How did I ever win your love?\"\nWhat did I do?\nWhat did I say\nTo turn your angel eyes my way?\n\nDon't anyone wake me\nIf it's just a dream\n'Cause she's the best thing\nEver happened to me\nAll you fellows\nYou can look all you like\nBut this girl you see\nShe's leavin' here with me tonight\n\nThere's just one more thing that I need to know\nIf this is love why does it scare me so?\nIt must be somethin' only you can see\n'Cause girl I feel it when you look at me\n\nSo tonight I'll ask the stars above\n\"How did I ever win your love?\"\nWhat did I do?\nWhat did I say\nTo turn your angel eyes my way?\nHey, hey, hey, yeah, awww"
