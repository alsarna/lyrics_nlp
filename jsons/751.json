    "lyrics": "Stars hang suspended\nAbove a floating yellow moon\nTwo hearts were blended\nWhile angels sang a lover's tune\n\nAnd so we kissed\nNot knowing if our hearts would pay the price\nBut heaven welcomed us to paradise\nBlessing our love\nThen came the sunrise\nFading the moon and stars from sight\n\nRecalling always\nOur wonderland by night"
