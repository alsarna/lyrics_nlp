    "lyrics": "After long enough of being alone\nEveryone must face their share of loneliness\nIn my own time nobody knew\nThe pain I was going through\nAnd waiting was all my heart could do\n\nHope was all I had until you came\nMaybe you can't see how much you mean to me\nYou were the dawn breaking the night\nThe promise of morning light\nFilling the world surrounding me\n\nAnd when I hold you\nBaby, baby, feels like maybe\nThings will be all right\nBaby, baby, your love's made me\nFree as a song singing forever\n\nOnly yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely\nYou showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me\nTomorrow may be even brighter than today\nSince I threw my sadness away\nOnly yesterday\n\nI have found my home here in your arms\nNowhere else on earth I'd really rather be\nLife waits for us, share it with me\nThe best is about to be\nAnd so much is left for us to see\nAnd when I hold you\nBaby, baby, feels like maybe\nThings will be all right\nBaby, baby, your love's made me\nFree as a song singing forever\n\nOnly yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely\nYou showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me\nTomorrow may be even brighter than today\nSince I threw my sadness away\nOnly yesterday\n\nOnly yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely\nYou showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me\nTomorrow may be even brighter than today\nSince I threw my sadness away\nOnly yesterday\n\nOnly yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely\nYou showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me\nTomorrow may be even brighter than today\nSince I threw my sadness away\nOnly yesterday"
