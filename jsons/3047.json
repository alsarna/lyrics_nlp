I tell you, honey\nI don't know why, I don't know why\nSo you think my singing's out of time? It makes me money\nI don't know why, I don't know why\nAnymore, oh, no\n\n[Chorus: Kevin DuBrow, Carlos Cavazo & Rudy Sarzo]\nSo come on, feel the noise\nGirls, rock your boys\nWe'll get wild, wild, wild\nWild, wild, wild\nCome on, feel the noise\nGirls, rock your boys\nWe'll get wild, wild, wild\nBaby!\n\n[Verse 2: Kevin DuBrow]\nSo you say I got a funny face? I got no worries\nAnd I don't know why, I don't know why\nOh, I gotta sing, it's some disgrace, I'm in no hurry\nAnd I don't know why, I don't know why\nAnymore, no, no, no\n[Chorus: Kevin DuBrow, Carlos Cavazo & Rudy Sarzo]\nCome on, feel the noise\nGirls, rock your boys\nWe'll get wild, wild, wild\nWild, wild, wild\nCome on, feel the noise\nGirls, rock your boys\nWe'll get wild, wild, wild, baby\nCome on!\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Verse 3: Kevin DuBrow & Carlos Cavazo]\nWell, you think we have a lazy time, you should know better\nI don't know why, I don't know why\nSo you say I got a dirty mind?
