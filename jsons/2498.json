    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe came from somewhere back in her long ago\nThe sentimental fool don't see\nTryin' hard to recreate\nWhat had yet to be created once in her life\nShe musters a smile for his nostalgic tale\nNever coming near what he wanted to say\nOnly to realize it never really was\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe had a place in his life\nHe never made her think twice\nAs he rises to her apology\nAnybody else would surely know\nHe's watching her go\n\n[Chorus]\nBut what a fool believes, he sees\nNo wise man has the power to reason away\nWhat seems to be\nIs always better than nothing\nThan nothing at all\n\n[Verse 2]\nKeeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago\nWhere he can still believe there's a place in her life\nSomeday, somewhere\nShe will return\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe had a place in his life\nHe never made her think twice\nAs he rises to her apology\nAnybody else would surely know\nHe's watching her go\n\n[Chorus]\nBut what a fool believes, he sees\nNo wise man has the power to reason away\nWhat seems to be\nIs always better than nothing\nThan nothing at all\nBut what a fool believes, he sees\nNo wise man has the power to reason away\nWhat seems to be\nIs always better than nothing\nThan nothing at all"
