(Lonely days, lonely nights)\nYeah, lonely days, (Lonely days,) lonely nights (Lonely nights)\nWhere would I be without my woman? (Lonely days, lonely nights)\nLonely days, (Lonely days,) lonely nights (Lonely nights)\nWhere would I be without my woman? (Lonely days, lonely nights)\nYeah, lonely days, (Lonely days,) lonely nights"
