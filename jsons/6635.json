Right?\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?\n\n[Verse 2]\n\n[Pink Sweat$, Jordan Davis, Sasha Sloan & Anne-Marie]\nI tried to imagine your reaction\nIt didn't scare me when the earthquake happened\nBut it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'\nStumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen\n[Anne-Marie & Noah Cyrus]\nAh, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how\nHow to think about you without it rippin' my heart out\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[FINNEAS & FLETCHER]\nI know, you know, we know you weren't\nDown for forever and it's fine\nI know, you know, we know we weren't\nMeant for each other and it's fine\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Sabrina Carpenter, Sam Smith, Niall Horan & Anne-Marie]\nBut if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over and you'd stay the night\nWould you love me for the hell of it?\nAll our fears would be irrelevant\n\n[Evaluna & Camilo, Sam Harris & FINNEAS]\nSi el mundo se acaba, ¿tú vendrías, verdad?\nLos dos cayendo con la gravedad\nAnd there wouldn't be a reason why\nWe would even have to say goodbye\n[H.E.R. & Maeta]\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nOh, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?\nRight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Mau y Ricky, Kesha & Jason Derulo]\nYo sé que tú sabes que amarno' de lejo' no es igual\nI know, you know, we know we weren't\nMeant for each other and it's fine\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Sam Smith & Kesha, Niall Horan & Kelsea Ballerini, Sam Smith & Florida Georgia Line]\nBut if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over and you'd stay the night (Stay the night)\nWould you love me for the hell of it? (Hell of it)\nAll our fears would be irrelevant\n\n[Sabrina Carpenter & Jason Derulo, Anthony Ramos & H.E.R., Jason Derulo & Alessia Cara & Sam Smith]\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nThe sky'd be falling while I hold you tight (Oh woah)\nNo, there wouldn't be a reason why\nWe would even have to say goodbye\n\n[Jason Derulo, JP Saxe & Julia Michaels, JP Saxe]\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?\nHmm\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?Embed"
