Right?\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?\n[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]\nI tried to imagine your reaction\nIt didn't scare me when the earthquake happened\nBut it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'\nStumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen\nAh, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how\nHow to think about you without it rippin' my heart out\n\n[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]\nAnd I know, you know, we know you weren't\nDown for forever and it's fine\nI know, you know, we know we weren't\nMeant for each other and it's fine\n\n[Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]\nBut if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over and you'd stay the night\nWould you love me for the hell of it?\nAll our fears would be irrelevant\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nSky'd be falling while I hold you tight\nNo, there wouldn't be a reason why\nWe would even have to say goodbye\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?\n[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]\nI know, you know, we know you weren't\nDown for forever and it's fine\nI know, you know, we know we weren't\nMeant for each other and it's fine\n\n[Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]\nBut if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over and you'd stay the night\nWould you love me for the hell of it?\nAll our fears would be irrelevant\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nThe sky'd be falling while I hold you tight\nNo, there wouldn't be a reason why\nWe would even have to say goodbye\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?\nYou'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?\n\n[Outro: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]\nHmm\nIf the world was ending, you'd come over, right?"
