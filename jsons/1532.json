    "lyrics": "{Introductory Monologue}\nThe continent of Atlantis was an island\nWhich lay before the great flood\nIn the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean\nSo great an area of land\nThat from her western shores\nThose beautiful sailors journeyed\nTo the South and the North Americas with ease\nIn their ships with painted sails\nTo the East Africa was her neighbor\nAcross a short strait of sea miles\nThe great Egyptian age is but a remnant of the Atlantean culture\nThe antediluvian kings colonised the world\nAll the Gods who play in the mythological dramas\nIn all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis\nKnowing her fate\nAtlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth\nOn board were the Twelve\nThe poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician\nAnd the other so-called Gods of our legends\nThough Gods they were\nAnd as the elders of our time choose to remain blind\nLet us rejoice and let us sing\nAnd dance and ring in the new\nHail Atlantis!\n{Chorus}\nWay down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be\nWay down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be\nWay down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be\nWay down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be\nWay down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be\n\n[Outro]\nMy antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah\nI wanna see you someday\nMy antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah\nMy antediluvian baby\nMy antediluvian baby, I love you, girl\nGirl, I wanna see you someday\nMy antediluvian baby, oh yeah\nI wanna see you someday, oh my antediluvian baby\nMy antediluvian baby, I wanna see you\nMy antediluvian baby, gotta tell me where she gone\nI wanna see you someday\nWake up, wake up, wake up, wake up"
