    "lyrics": "If you want something to play with\nGo and find yourself a toy\nBaby my time is too expensive\nAnd I'm not a little boy\n\nIf you are serious\nDon't play with my heart\nIt makes me furious\nBut if you want me to love you\nThen a baby I will, girl you know that I will\n\nTell it like it is\nDon't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide\nBut I know deep down inside me\nI believe you love me, forget your foolish pride\n\nLife is too short to have sorrow\nYou may be here today and gone tomorrow\nYou might as well get what you want\nSo go on and live, baby go on and live\n\nTell it like it is\nI'm nothing to play with\nGo and find yourself a toy\nBut I... Tell it like it is\nMy time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy"
