    "lyrics": "You take a bus marked \"Lakewood Drive\"\nAnd you keep on drivin' till you're out of the city\nWhere the air is fine with the sweet smellin pine\nAnd the countryside's pretty\nAnd you'll see daffodils peepin over\nThe hills or a honey lovin' mama bear\n\nYou just take a left at the bridge\nGo down to Quakerforn Ridge\nAnd in a minute you're there\n(dupe do be do do do )\n\nIndian Lake is a scene\nYou should make with your little one\nKeep it in mind if you're lookin to find\nA place in the summer sun\nSwim in the cove have a snack in the grove\nOr you can rent a canoe at Indian Lake\nYou'll be able to make the way the Indians do"
