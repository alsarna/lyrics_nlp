    "lyrics": "Young emotions are mixed emotions\nFor it's a wold where love and confusion reign\nA world of hope and laughter and tears and pain\nAt times a gentle breezed and a hurricane\nA world full of doubt but love works it out\n\nYoung emotions and strange emotions\nFor though we're brave sometimes we are so afraid\nBut knowing there are memories to be made\nWe'll face each new tomarrow dear undismayed\nFor our love will keep us together\nAnd our love will help us to weather\nThese young emotions\n\nFor though we're brave sometimes we are so afraid\nBut knowing there are memories to be made\nWe'll face each new tomarrow dear undismayed\nFor our love will keep us together\nAnd our love will help us to weather\nThese young emotions"
