(Bless your soul)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds\nYou made a fool out of me and, boy, you're bringin' me down\nYou made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core\nBut rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for\n\n[Chorus]\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\n\n[Bridge]\nAll of these words whispered in my ear\nTell a story that I cannot bear to hear\nJust 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it\nPeople say crazy things\nJust 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it\nJust 'cause you heard it\n[Chorus]\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour, rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it (Rumour)\nRumour has it\n\n[Outro]\nBut rumour has it, he's the one I'm leaving you for"
