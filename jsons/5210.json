    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI still hear your voice when you sleep next to me\nI still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream)\nForgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why\nWithout you, it's hard to survive\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling\nAnd every time we kiss, I swear I could fly\nCan't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last\nNeed you by my side\n'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static\nAnd every time we kiss, I reach for the sky\nCan't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go\nWant you in my life\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour arms are my castle, your heart is my sky\nThey wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)\nThe good and the bad times, we've been through them all\nYou make me rise when I fall\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling\nAnd every time we kiss, I swear I could fly\nCan't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last\nNeed you by my side\n'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static\nAnd every time we kiss, I reach for the sky\nCan't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go\nWant you in my life\n[Outro]\n'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling\nAnd every time we kiss, I swear I could fly\nCan't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last\nNeed you by my side"
