    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIf a picture paints a thousand words\nThen why can't I paint you?\nThe words will never show\nThe you I've come to know\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf a face could launch a thousand ships\nThen where am I to go?\nThere's no one home but you\nYou're all that's left me too\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd when my love for life is running dry\nYou come and pour yourself on me\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf a man could be two places at one time\nI'd be with you\nTomorrow and today\nBeside you all the way\n\n[Verse 4]\nIf the world should stop revolving\nSpinning slowly down to die\nI'd spend the end with you\nAnd when the world was through\n[Chorus 2]\nThen one by one the stars would all go out\nThen you and I, would simply fly away"
