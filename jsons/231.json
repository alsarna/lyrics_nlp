    "lyrics": "Thee I love, more than the meadow so green and still\nMore than the mulberries on the hill\nMore than the buds of a May apple tree, I love thee\n\nArms have I, strong as the oak, for this occasion\nLips have I, to kiss thee, too, in friendly persuasion\n\nThee is mine, though I don't know many words of praise\nThee pleasures me in a hundred ways\nPut on your bonnet, your cape, and your glove\nAnd come with me, for thee I love\n\nFriendly persuasion\n\nThee is mine, though I don't know many words of praise\nThee pleasures me in a hundred ways\nPut on your bonnet, your cape, and your glove\nAnd come with me, for thee I love"
