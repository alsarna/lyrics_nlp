I was standing\nYou were there\nTwo worlds collided\nAnd they could never tear us apart\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe could live\nFor a thousand years\nBut if I hurt you\nI'd make wine from your tears\nI told you\nThat we could fly\n'Cause we all have wings\nBut some of us don't know why\n[Chorus]\nI... I was standing\nYou were there\nTwo worlds collided\nAnd they could never, ever tear us apart\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nI... I was standing\nYou were there\nTwo worlds collided\nAnd they could never ever tear us apart\n\n[Chorus]\nYou... You were standing\nI was there\nTwo worlds collided\nAnd they could never tear us apart\n\n[Outro]\nI... I was standing\nYou were there11Embed"
