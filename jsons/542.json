    "lyrics": "I cried a tear because of you\nI cried a tear because we're through\nI cried a tear, what else could I do\nBut cry and sigh for love of you\n\nI felt a tear fall in my heart\nYou fooled me so, I wasn't smart\nI can't believe that we must part\nCome back to stay, let's make a new start\n\nI cried a tear because of you\nI cried a tear because we're through\nPlease make my dreams of you come true\nDon't make me cry a tear for you\nDon't make me cry a tear for you"
