Shit Lyrics[Curren$y]\nIt's not what you know, it's what you can prove\nAnd I can so prove, that I'm better than you\nSweater, neck crew\nFuck your dress code, let the Jets through\nSmelling like, medical\nSee it my way, life from a better view, loser\nLiving life, not making moves - vegetable\nMight as well be dead\nRedline in the old school\nClassy, call that museum riding\nYeah, fuck you thought\nI fell off?, Nah, I fell back\nCountach, put the doors up\nCall the weed man and a couple hoes up\nShooting pool...\nThinking 'bout when pops used to bring me to the barber shop\nThat was cool...\nBumping smokey, '84 Grand National rolling\nAll I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit\nJacked The Caribbean Queen from Billy Ocean\nBring her back before the nigga even notice\nSmooth sails...\nSpitta prevail and these counterfeit niggas fail, yea\nSmooth sails...\nSpitta prevail and these counterfeit niggas fail, yea\nAll I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit\nAll I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit\nAll I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit\nAll I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shitEmbed"
