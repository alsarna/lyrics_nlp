    "lyrics": "I found out that you care for another guy\nI found out that you want for another smile\nWe are alone as two different people can be\nAnd it's hurting me so\nJust to know that you don't care for me\n\nThe other guy won't be around to talk to our kids\nHe won't understand when you're down the way that I did\nWe had it all, you and I, we just need to try again\n\nI found out that your heart's with another guy\nYou found out that you're tellin' another lie\nWe've grown apart and goin' our own separate ways\nAnd you don't understand\nWhy I love you and want you to stay\n\nThe other guy won't be around to talk to our kids\nHe won't understand when you're down the way that I did\nWe had it all, you and I, we just need to try again\n\nYou don't know it's me that you need\nYou're thinking of him and I can't compete\nBut I'm here to say I still want you back again\n\nThe other guy won't be around to talk to our kids\nHe won't understand when you're down the way that I did\nWe had it all, you and I, we just need to try again\nThe other guy won't be around to talk to our kids\nHe won't understand when you're down the way that I did\nWe had it all, you and I, we just need to try again\n\nThe other guy won't be around to talk to our kids\nHe won't understand when you're down the way that I did\nWe had it all, you and I, we just need to try again"
