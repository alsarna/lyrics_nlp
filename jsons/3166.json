    "lyrics": "I've been lonely\nI've been waiting for you\nI'm pretending and that's all I can do\nThe love I'm sending\nAin't making it through to your heart\nYou've been hiding, never letting it show\nAlways trying to keep it under control\nYou got it down and you're well\nOn the way to the top\nBut there's something that you forgot\n\nWhat about love\nDon't you want someone to care about you\nWhat about love\nDon't let it slip away\nWhat about love\nI only want to share it with you\nYou might need it someday\n\nI can't tell you what you're feeling inside\nI can't sell you what you don't want to buy\nSomething's missing and you got to\nLook back on your life\nYou know something here just ain't right\n\nWhat about love\nDon't you want someone to care about you\nWhat about love\nDon't let it slip away\nWhat about love\nI only want to share it with you\nWhat about love\nDon't you want someone to care about you\nWhat about love\nDon't let it slip away\nWhat about love\nI only want to share it with you"
