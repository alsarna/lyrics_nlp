    "lyrics": "I realize the way your eyes deceived me\nWith tender looks that I mistook for love\nSo take away the flowers that you gave me\nAnd send the kind that you remind me of\nPaper roses\nPaper roses\n\nOh how real those roses seem to be\nBut they're only imitation\nLike your imitation love for me\n\nI thought that you would be a perfect lover\nYou seemed so full of sweetness at the start\nBut like a big red rose that's made of paper\nThere isn't any sweetness in your heart\n\nPaper roses\nPaper roses\nOh how real those roses seem to be\nBut they're only imitation\nLike your imitation love for me\nLike your imitation love for me"
