    "lyrics": "Four Walls LyricsOut where the bright lights are glowing\nYou're drawn like a moth to a flame\nYou laugh while the wine's overflowing\nWhile I sit and whisper your name\n\nFour walls to hear me\nFour walls to see\nFour walls too near me\nClosing in on me\n\nSometimes I ask why I'm waiting\nBut my walls have nothing to say\nI'm made for love not for hating\nSo here where you left me I'll stay\n\nOne night with you is like heaven\nAnd so while I'm walking the floor\nI listen for steps in the hallway\nAnd wait for your knock on my door\nFour walls to hear me\nFour walls to see\nFour walls too near me\nClosing in on me\n\nClosing in on meEmbed"
