And haven't seen my girl since then\nWhy can't it be the way it was' cause you were my Homie, lover, and friend\n\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI wanna make up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na\nWish we never broke up right now na na\nWe need to link up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na\nWish we never broke up right now na na\nWe need to link up right now na na\n[Bridge: Akon]\nI can't lie (Miss you much)\nWatching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)\nTill I get you back I'm gon' try (Yes, I miss you much)\nCuz you are the apple of my eye (Girl, I miss you much)\nI can't lie (I miss you much)\nWatching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)\nTill I get you back I'm gon' try (Yes I miss you much)\nCuz you are the apple of my eye (Girl, I miss you much)\n\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI wanna make up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na\nWish we never broke up right now na na\nWe need to link up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na\nWish we never broke up right now na na\nWe need to link up right now na na\n\n[Bridge: Akon]\nI want you to fly with me (Want you to fly)\nI miss how you lie with me (Miss how you lie)\nJust wish you could dine with me (Wish you could dine with me)\nThe one that'll grind with me (Said the one that will grind with me)\nI want you to fly with me (Want you to fly)\nI miss how you lie with me (Oh, miss how you lie)\nJust wish you could dine with me (Wish you could dine)\nThe one that'll grind with me (Oh, the one that'll grind)...\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI wanna make up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na (Make up)\nWish we never broke up right now na na\nWe need to link up right now na na (Link up, link up)\nI wanna make up right now na na\nI wanna make up right now na na\nWish we never broke up right now na na\nWe need to link up right now na na"
