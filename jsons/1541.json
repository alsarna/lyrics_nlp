    "lyrics": "Aww, she didn't bat an eye\nAs I packed my bags to leave\nI thought she would start to cry\nOr sit around my room and grieve\n\nBut y'all, the girl\nShe fooled me this time\nShe acted like I was\nThe last thing on her mind\nI would like to start all over again\n\nBaby, can I change my mind\nI just wanna change my mind\nBaby, let me change my mind\n\nAs I took those steps\nToward that open door\nKnowing all the time\nOh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go\n\nBut she didn't give me no sign\nNothing that would\nMake me change my mind\nI would like to start all over again\n\nBaby, can I change my mind\nPlease, please, please, baby\nI just wanna change my mind\nOh, I played my games\nMany times before\nBut, peoples, let me tell y'all\nOh, I never reached the door\n\nBut, ooh, the winds howl tonight\nI keep looking back but\nMy baby's not in sight\nI would like to start all over again\n\nBaby, can I change my mind\nPlease, please, please, baby\nBaby, let me change my mind"
