    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe heart of the city street was beating\nLight from the neons turned the dark to day\nWe were too hot to think of sleeping\nWe had to get out before the magic got away\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were running with the night\nPlaying in the shadows\nJust you and I, 'til the morning light\nWe were running, running with the night\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou were looking so good girl, heads were turning\nYou and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out\nThe fire was in us, we were burning\nWe were going to go all the way and we never had a doubt\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were running with the night\nPlaying in the shadows\nJust you and I, 'til the morning light\nWe were running, running with the night\n\n[Bridge]\nWe were so in love you and me\nOn the boulevard wild and free\nGiving all we got, we laid it down\nTaking every shot, we took the town\n[Chorus]\nWe were running with the night\nPlaying in the shadows\nJust you and I, 'til the morning light\nWe were running, running with the night\nWe were running with the night\nPlaying in the shadows\nJust you and I, 'til the morning light\nWe were running, running with the night\n\n[Outro]\nJust you and I, girl it was so right (We were running)\nGirl so right (running with the night)\nSo right"
