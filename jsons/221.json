    "lyrics": "Gather round me buddies\nHold your glasses high\nAnd drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye\n\nToo late he found out he loves her\nSo much he wants to die\nBut drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye\n\nHe needs her, he needs her so\nHe wonders why he let her go-oo-oo\n\nShe's found a new love, buddy\nHe's a lucky guy\nSo drink to the fool, 'cause I'm that fool who told his baby goodbye\n\nHe needs her, he needs her so\nHe wonders why he let her go-oo-oo\n\nShe's found a new love, buddy\nHe's a lucky guy\nSo drink to the fool, 'cause I'm that fool who told my baby goodbye\nMy baby goodbye\nWho told my baby, who told my baby..."
