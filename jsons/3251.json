    "lyrics": "Well, I was born in a small town\nAnd I live in a small town\nProbably die in a small town\nOh, those small communities\n\nAll my friends are so small town\nMy parents live in the same small town\nMy job is so small town\nProvides little opportunity\n\nEducated in a small town\nTaught to fear Jesus in a small town\nUsed to daydream in that small town\nAnother boring romantic, that's me\n\nBut I've seen it all in a small town\nHad myself a ball in a small town\nMarried an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town\nNow she's small town just like me\n\nNo, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from\nI cannot forget the people who love me\nYeah, I can be myself here in this small town\nAnd people let me be just what I want to be\n\nGot nothing against a big town\nStill hayseed enough to say, \"look who's in the big town\"\nBut my bed is in a small town\nOh, and that's good enough for me\nWell, I was born in a small town\nAnd I can breathe in a small town\nGonna die in this small town\nOh that's probably where they'll bury me"
