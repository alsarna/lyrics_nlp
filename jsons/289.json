( . . . this is really love! )\nFind a wheel, ( find a wheel . . . ) and it goes round, round, round\nAs it skims along with a happy sound\nAs it goes, ( as it goes . . . ) along the ground, ground, ground\n‘Till it leads you to the one you love! ( . . . to the one you love! )\n\nThen your love, ( then your love ) you'll hold her round, round, round\nAnd your heart's a song with a brand new sound\nAnd your head, ( and your head ) goes spinning round, round, round\n‘Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of! ( . . . you've been dreamin' of! )\n\nIn the night you see the oval moon\nGoin' round and round in tune ( going round and round! )\nAnd the ball of sun in the day\nMakes a girl and boy wanna say: ( wanna say, wanna say! )\n\nFind the ring, ( find the ring . . . ) and put it round, round, round\nAnd with ties so strong your two hearts are bound\nPut it on, the one you found, found, found\nFor you kno' that this is really love!\n\nFind a ring, put it on\nFor you kno' that this is really love\nReally love . . . really love . . . hmmm!Embed"
