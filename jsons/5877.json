    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nA couple of guys in first class on a flight\nFrom New York to Los Angeles\nKinda making small talk killing time\nFlirting with the flight attendants\nThirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms\nMan, it all looks the same\nMiles and miles of back roads and highways\nConnecting little towns with funny names\nWho'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey've never drove through Indiana\nMet the men who plowed that earth\nPlanted that seed, busted his ass for you and me\nOr caught a harvest moon in Kansas\nThey'd understand why God made\nThose flyover states\n\n[Verse 4]\nI bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all\nJust like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul\nRoads and rails under their feet\nYeah that sounds like a first class seat\n[Verse 5]\nOn the plains of Oklahoma\nWith a windshield sunset in your eyes\nLike a water-colored painted sky\nYou'll think heaven's doors have opened\nYou'll understand why God made\nThose flyover states\n\n[Verse 6]\nTake a ride across the badlands\nFeel that freedom on your face\nBreathe in all that open space\nAnd meet a girl from Amarillo\nYou'll understand why God made\nYou might even wanna plant your stakes\nIn those flyover states\n(Yeah)\n\n[Outro]\nHave you ever been through Indiana?\nOn the plains of Oklahoma?\nTake a ride"
