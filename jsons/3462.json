    "lyrics": "Donâ€™t Shed a Tear LyricsCab fare to nowhere is what you are\nA white line to an exit sign is what you are\nOh but I saw in you, now I see through\n\nCHORUS:\nDon't shed a tear for me\nMy life won't end without you\nLong as the night will be\nThe sun will rise without you\nA locked door on a candy store is what you are\nA slim chance in tight pants is what you are\nAll that I loved you for, I want it more\n\nCHORUS\nYou are giving what I'm not taking\nI'm not missing what we ain't making\nOh but I saw in you, now I see through\nCHORUS\n\nCHORUS\n\nDon't shed no tears\nI don't need a thingEmbed"
