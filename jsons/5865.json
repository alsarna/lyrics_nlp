We do this every night\nAnd then, we always wake up singing the same song\n[Chorus: Lily Allen & T-Pain, Both]\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)\nConversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)\nYou said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping (All right)\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning\nThe conversation got boring\nYou said you'd go in to bed soon\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in\n\n[Verse 2: T Pain & Lily Allen]\nIt's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling\nAnd these females got me stalling\nI can hear your voice in my head, like\n\"What is he doing?\" (Oh) \"What is he doing?\"\n'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls\nAnd you texting me, like, \"I'ma kill y'all\nIf you don't get your ass up out of that club\nAnd do you know what time it is?\"\n(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)\nWell, my bad, girl\nAnd this Nuvo got me tripping, and I know that you mad, girl\nBut you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)\nGirl, I got you (I got you), girl I got you\nShe might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)\nAnd then ask me kindly-y (Oh, no, no)\nDo I want her to go crazy? (Crazy) We do this every night\nAnd then, we always wake up singing the same song\n[Chorus: Lily Allen, T-Pain, & Both]\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)\nConversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)\nYou said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there (Ooh, wait on me)\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping (All right)\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in (Baby girl, goodnight)\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning\nThe conversation got boring\nYou said you'd go in to bed soon\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in\n\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa, Lily Allen, & T-Pain]\nOh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on\nBut the T-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya\nToo many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her\nAnd you'll be right at home, waiting for me\nIPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me\nClub closed at 6, left around 4:30\nYeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—\n(It’s 5 o' clock in the morning) And you yawning\nBut I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing\nWith you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser\nDont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one\nSo I let you—that's how you show me love\nAnd when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up” (Whoa, oh)\nI like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us (Oh, oh)\nThe sun ain't the only thing that's coming up (Oh, yeah)\n[Chorus: T-Pain & Lily Allen; Wiz Khalifa]\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning (Hahahahaha)\nThe conversation got boring\nYou said you'd go in to bed soon\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning25Embed"
