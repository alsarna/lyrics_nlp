    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI don't know how to love him\nWhat to do, how to move him\nI've been changed, yes really changed\nIn these past few days when I've seen myself\nI seem like someone else\n\nI don't know how to take this\nI don't see why he moves me\nHe's a man, he's just a man\nAnd I've had so many men before\nIn very many ways\nHe's just once more\n\n[Chorus]\nShould I bring him down?\nShould I scream and shout?\nShould I speak of love\nLet my feelings out?\nI never thought I'd come to this\nWhat's it all about\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't you think it's rather funny\nI should be in this position\nI'm the one who's always been\nSo calm, so cool, no lover's fool\nRunning every show\nHe scares me so\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nYes, if he said he loved me\nI'd be lost, I'd be frightened\nI couldn't cope, just couldn't cope\nI'd turn my head, I'd back away\nI wouldn't want to know\nHe scares me so\nI want him so\nI love him so"
