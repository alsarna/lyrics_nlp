    "lyrics": "When somebody loves you\nIts no good unless he loves you...\nAll the way\nHappy to be near you\nWhen you need someone to cheer you\nAll the way\n\nTaller than the tallest tree is\nThats how its got to feel\nDeeper than the deep blue sea is\nThats how deep it goes if its real\n\nWhen somebody needs you\nIts no good unless she needs you\nAll the way\n\nThrough the good or lean years\nAnd for all those in between years\nCome what may\n\nWho knows where the road will lead us\nOnly a fool would say\nBut if you let me love you\nIts for sure I'm gonna love you\nAll the way\nAll the way...\n\nSo if you let me love you\nIts for sure I'm gonna love you\nAll the way\nAll.. The ... Way..."
