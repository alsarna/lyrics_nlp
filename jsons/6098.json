(Where are you now?)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nWhere are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere\nWhen you broke down, I didn't leave ya (I didn't leave ya)\nI was by your side\nSo where are you now that I need ya? (Need ya)\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\n[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]\nI gave you attention when nobody else was payin'\nI gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'? To keep you warm\nI showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure (That's for sure)\nAnd I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\nI need you the, I need you, I need you the, I need you, I need you, where are you now that I need ya?\nI need you the, I need you, I need you, I need you the most\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\nWhere are you now that I need ya?\n\n[Outro: Justin Bieber]\nI need you the most (I need you the most)"
