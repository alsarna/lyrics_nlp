    "lyrics": "Tell It Like It Is LyricsIf you want something to play with\nGo and find yourself a toy\nCause baby, baby, my time is much too expensive\nAnd I don't want no little boy\n\nBut if you, if you are serious\nDon't go playing with my heart, it makes me furious\nAnd if want me to love you\nOoo baby, I will, ooo yeah I will\n\nTell it like it is\nOh yeah, just let your conscience be your guide\nYou know, deep down inside\nI believe you love me, just forget your foolish pride\n\nI think life's too short for all this sorrow\nWe might be here today and gone tomorrow\nI might as well just get what I want\nI wanna live, I wanna live\nTell it like it is\nDon't be ashamed now let your conscience be your guide\nOoo yeah deep down inside\nI believe you love me, just forget your foolish pride\nOh oh, oh oh oh oh ohEmbed"
