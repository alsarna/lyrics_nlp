    "lyrics": "Ooh wah ooh wah, ooh wah ooh wah\nOoh wah ooh wah, why do fools fall in love?\nWhy do birds sing so gay and lovers await the break of day?\nWhy do they fall in love?\nWhy does the rain fall from up above?\nWhy do fools fall in love? Why do they fall in love?\nLove is a losing game, love can put people to shame\nI know of a fool you see, for that fool is me\nTell my why?\nWhy do birds sing so gay and lovers await the break of day?\nWhy do they fall in love?\nWhy does the rain fall from up above?\nWhy do fools fall in love? Why do they fall in love?\nWhy does my heart skip crazy beat?\nFor I know not will reach defeat\nTell me why?\nWhy do fools fall in love?"
