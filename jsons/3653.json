    "lyrics": "Here we are, face to face\nWe forget, time and place\nHold me now, don't let go\nThough it hurts and we both know why\n\nThe time we spend together's gonna fly\nAnd everything you do to me is gonna feel so right\nBaby when you're loving me I feel like I could cry\n'Cause there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you\n\nHere we are, all alone\nTrembling hearts, beating strong\nReaching out, a breathless kiss\nI never thought could feel like this\n\nI want to stop the time from passing by\nI wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine\nBaby when you're close to me, I want you more each time\nAnd there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you\n\nThere's nothing I can do\nI'm helpless in your arms\nOh baby what you do\nI'm in love, this is it\nThere's no turning back this time\nNo, no, no\nHere we are, once again\nBut this time we're only friends\nFunny world, sometimes lies\nBecome the game, when love's the prize\n\nAnd though no one knows what's going on inside\nAnd all the love I feel for you is something I should hide\nWhen I have you close to me, the feeling's so sublime\nThat there's nothing I can do to keep from loving you\n\nNo, no, no\nCan't keep from loving you baby\nNo, no, no\nThere is nothing I can do, my baby\nCan't keep from loving you"
