    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStrolling along country roads with my baby\nIt starts to rain, it begins to pour\nWithout an umbrella, we're soaked to the skin\nI feel a shiver run up my spine\nI feel the warmth of her hand in mine\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I hear laughter in the rain\nWalking hand in hand with the one I love\nOh, how I love the rainy days\nAnd the happy way I feel inside\n\n[Verse 2]\nAfter a while we run under a tree (after a while)\nI turn to her and she kisses me\nThere with the beat of the rain on the leaves (there with the beat)\nSoftly she breathes and I close my eyes\nSharing our love under stormy skies\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I hear laughter in the rain\nWalking hand in hand with the one I love\nOh, how I love the rainy days\nAnd the happy way I feel inside\n[Saxophone solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nI feel the warmth of her hand in mine\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I hear laughter in the rain\nWalking hand in hand with the one I love\nOh, how I love the rainy days\nAnd the happy way I feel inside\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I hear laughter in the rain\nWalking hand in hand with the one I love\nOh, how I love the rainy days\nAnd the happy way I feel inside"
