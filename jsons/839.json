    "lyrics": "Moon River\nWider than a mile\nI'm crossin' you in style\nSome day\nOld dream maker\nYou heart breaker\nWherever your goin'\nI'm goin' your way\nTwo drifters\nOff to see the world\nThere's such a lot of world\nTo see\nWe're after the same\nRainbow's end\nWaitin' round the bend\nMy huckleberry friend\nMoon River\nAnd me"
