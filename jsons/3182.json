But it's our first love\nAll the feelings that we used to share\nI refuse to believe that you don't care\n\n[Chorus]\nI miss you (I miss you)\nThere's no other way to say it (And I), and I can't deny it\nI miss you (I miss you)\nIt's so easy to see\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've got to gather my senses together\nI've been through worse kinds of weather\nIf it's over now, I'll be strong, I can't believe that you're gone\nI've got to carry on, but\n\n[Chorus]\nI miss you (I miss you)\nOh, no other way to say it (And I), and I can't deny it\nI miss you (I miss you)\nIt's so easy to see that you're part of me now\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, no other way to say it\nIt's so easy to see that you're part of me now\nIt's drivin' me crazy\nIt's so easy to see that you're part of me now, that you're part of me now\n[Outro]\nI miss you (I miss you)\nIt's drivin' me crazy, I don't want to live without you\nI miss you (I miss you)\nIt's so easy to see I'm missin' meEmbed"
