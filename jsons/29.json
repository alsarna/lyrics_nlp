    "lyrics": "(Chorus: Frankie Laine)\nMy heart knows what the wild goose knows\nI must go where the wild goose goes\nWild goose, brother goose, which is best\nA wandering foot or a heart at rest?\n\n(Verse 1: Frankie Laine)\nTonight I heard the wild goose cry\nWinging north in the lonely sky\nTried to sleep but it weren't no use\nBecause I am a brother to the old wild goose\n\n(Chorus: The Easy Riders)\n\n(Verse 2: Frankie Laine)\nWoman was kind and true to me\nShe thinks she loves me, the more fool she\nShe's gotta learn that it ain't no use\nTo love a brother of the old wild goose\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, you wild goose\n\n(Verse 3: Frankie Laine)\nThe cabin is warm and the snow is deep\nI got a woman who lies asleep\nShe'll wake at tomorrow's dawn\nShe'll find, poor critter, that her man is gone\nOh, you wild goose\n(Chorus: Frankie Laine)\nLet me fly, let me fly, let me fly away\n\n(Verse 4: Frankie Laine)\nSpring is coming and the ice will break\nI can't linger for a woman's sake\nShe'll see a shadow pass overhead\nShe'll find my feathers beside my bed\n\n(Chorus)\nWild goose, wild goose, wild goose, wild goose"
