Ahh...\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you...\n\n[Verse 1]\nSitting at home another lonely night\nWish you were here so I can hold you tight\nPain in my heart because I'm all alone\nWhy did you leave\nWhy did your love have to gooo\nAnd I would do anything for you\nI would\nThinking of ways that I could win your heart\nBut I'm so confused, I don't know where to start\nVisions of love forever in my mind\nI wait for the day when I can say that love's mine\n'Cause I would do anything for you\nYes, I would\n[Chorus]\nI'll give you love\nThe things you want\nBaby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo what can I do to prove I need your love\nWhat will it take because I won't give up\nOpen your heart and let your feelings show\n'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you gooo\nGirl, I would do anything for you\nYes, I would\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll give you love\nThe things you want\nBaby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo if there ever comes a time\nWhen it's true love you hope to find\nJust call out my name\nAnd girl, that's when I would do anything\nI'll give you love\n(I'll give you love oh, I'll give you love girl)\n(I'll give you love oh, I'll give you love girl)\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything for you\nI would do anything, girl, anything for you\n\nI'll give you love\nThe things you want...Embed"
