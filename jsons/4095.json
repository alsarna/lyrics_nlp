Lyrics[Verse 1]\nTo really love a woman\nTo understand her - You gotta know her deep inside\nHear every thought - See every dream\nAnd give her wings when she wants to fly\nThen when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms\nYou know you really love a woman\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you love a woman\nYou tell her that she's really wanted\nWhen you love a woman you tell her that she's the one\n'Cause she needs somebody\nTo tell her that it's gonna last forever\nSo tell me have you ever really\nReally, really ever loved a woman?\n[Verse 2]\nTo really love a woman - Let her hold you\n'Til you know how she needs to be touched\nYou've gotta breathe her - really taste her\n'Til you can feel her in your blood\nAnd when you can see your unborn children in her eyes\nYou know you really love a woman\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you love a woman\nYou tell her that she's really wanted\nWhen you love a woman you tell her that she's the one\n'Cause she needs somebody\nTo tell her that you'll always be together\nSo tell me have you ever really\nReally, really ever loved a woman?\n\n[Bridge]\nOh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight\nA little tenderness - gotta treat her right\nShe will be there for you, takin' good care of you\nYou really gotta love your woman\n\nThen when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms\nYou know you really love a woman\n[Chorus]\nWhen you love a woman\nYou tell her that she's really wanted\nWhen you love a woman you tell her that she's the one\n'Cause she needs somebody\nTo tell her that it's gonna last forever\nSo tell me have you ever really\nReally, really ever loved a woman?\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, just tell me have you ever really\nReally, really ever loved a woman?\nOh, just tell me have you ever really\nReally, really ever loved a woman?2Embed"
