    "lyrics": "Faithfully Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHighway run into the midnight sun\nWheels go 'round and 'round, you're on my mind\nRestless hearts sleep alone tonight\nSendin' all my love along the wire\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say that the road ain't no place to start a family\nRight down the line, it's been you and me\nAnd lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be\nOh, girl, you stand by me\nI'm forever yours\nFaithfully\n\n[Verse 2]\nCircus life under the big top world\nWe all need the clowns to make us smile\nThrough space and time, always another show\nWonderin' where I am, lost without you\n[Chorus]\nAnd bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair\nTwo strangers learn to fall in love again\nI get the joy of rediscovering you\nOh, girl, you stand by me\nI'm forever yours\nFaithfully\n\n[Outro]\nWhoa-oh, oh-oh\nWhoa-oh, oh-oh-oh\nWhoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\nFaithfully\nI'm still yours\nI'm forever yours\n'Ever yours\nFaithfully16Embed"
