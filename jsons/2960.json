    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHighway run into the midnight sun\nWheels go round and round, you're on my mind\nRestless hearts sleep alone tonight\nSending all my love along the wire\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say that the road ain't no place to start a family\nRight down the line it's been you and me\nAnd lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be\nOh, girl, you stand by me\nI'm forever yours, faithfully\n\n[Drum + Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 2]\nCircus life under the big top world\nWe all need the clowns to make us smile\nThrough space and time, always another show\nWondering where I am, lost without you\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd being apart ain't easy on this love affair\nTwo strangers learn to fall in love again\nI get the joy of rediscovering you\nOh, girl, you stand by me\nI'm forever yours, faithfully\n[Outro]\nWhoa, oh-oh-ooh\nWhoa, oh-oh-ooh, oh\nWhoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-whoooooa-oh\nFaithfully\nI'm still yours\nI'm forever yours\nEver yours\nFaithfully"
