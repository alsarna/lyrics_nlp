    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe night was black, rain fallin' down\nLooked for my baby, she's nowhere around\nTraced her footsteps down to the shore\n'Fraid she's gone forevermore\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI looked at the sea, and it seemed to say\n“I took your baby from you away\"\nI heard a voice cryin' in the deep\n“Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy did we quarrel?  Why did we fight?\nWhy did I leave her alone tonight?\nThat's why her footsteps ran into the sea\nThat's why my baby has gone from me\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI looked at the sea, and it seemed to say\n“I took your baby from you away\"\nI heard a voice cryin' in the deep\n“Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nRan in the water, heart full of fear\nThere in the breaker I saw her near\nReached for my darlin', held her to me\nStole her away from the angry sea\n[Chorus 2]\nI looked at the sea and it seemed to say\n“You took your baby from me away\"\nMy heart cried out, “She's mine to keep\nI saved my baby from an endless sleep\n\n[Outro]\nEndless sleep\nEndless sleep\nEndless sleep\nEndless sleep\""
