    "lyrics": "I am glad you've finally called me on the phone\nI've been waiting here tonight but not alone\nYou broke the date that we had made just yesterday\nNow there's someone else who's here, he'll have to stay\n\nI have found another love I know is true\nAnd he holds me much more tenderly than you\nLoving you's not worth the price I have to pay\nSomeone else is in your place, he'll have to stay\n\nOnce I loved you with all my heart\nBut now I must say no\nYou broke my heart too many times\nSo now you'll have to go\n\nI can hear the jukebox playing soft and low\nAnd you're out again with someone else, I know\nMy love was blind, I'm not your kind that's all I'll say\nSo you can hang up, I'm in his arms, he'll have to stay\n\nNow someone else is in your place, he'll have to stay"
