    "lyrics": "We dreamers have our ways\nOf facing rainy days\nAnd somehow we survive\n\nWe keep the feelings warm\nProtect them from the storm\nUntil our time arrives\n\nThen one day the sun appears\nAnd we come shining through those lonely years\n\nI made it through the rain\nI kept my world protected\nI made it throught the rain\nI kept my point of view\nI made it through the rain\nAnd found myself respected\nBy the others who\nGot rained on too\nAnd made it through\n\nWhen friends are hard to find\nAnd life seems so unkind\nSometimes you feel afraid\n\nJust aim beyond the clouds\nAnd rise above the crowds\nAnd start your own parade\nCause when I chased my fears away\nThat's when I knew that I could finally say\n\nI made it through the rain\nI kept my world protected\nI made it throught the rain\nI kept my point of view\nI made it through the rain\nAnd found myself respected\nBy the others who\nGot rained on too\nAnd made it through...\n\nREPEAT CHORUS"
