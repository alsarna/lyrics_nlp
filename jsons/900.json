    "lyrics": "I love you because you understand, dear\nEvery single thing I try to do\nYou're always there to lend a helping hand, dear\nI love you most of all because you're you\n\nNo matter what the world may say about me\nI know your love will always see me through\n\nI love you for the way you never doubt me\nBut, most of all I love you 'cause you're you\n\n(I love you because the future's brighter)\n(The door to happiness shall open wide)\n\nNo matter what the world may say about me\nI know your love will always see me through\n\nI love you for a hundred thousand reasons\nBut, most of all I love you 'cause you're you"
