    "lyrics": "Smoke from a Distant Fire LyricsYou left me here on your way to paradise\nAnd you pulled the rug right out from under my life\nI know where you goin' to, I knew when you came home last night\n'Cause your eyes had a mist from the smoke of a distant fire\n\nLord, I was stunned, shoulda seen it come a long time ago\nWhen I realized, the reality gave me a roll\nIf things are the same, then explain why your kiss is so cold\nAnd that mist in your eyes feels like rain on the fire in my soul\n\nThis lyin' and cryin' is upsettin' and gettin' nowhere\nIt don't stack up, so slack up, then pack up, I just don't care\nDon't let the screen door hit you on your way out\nDon't you drown when your dreamboat runs onto the ground\n\nI'd just like to know, do you love him or just makin' time\nBy filling his glass with your fast-flowing bittersweet lime\nYou'll face the aftertaste when you come home late some night\nWith your eyes all a-mist from the smoke of a distant fire\nGirl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire\n(Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire)\nGirl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire\n(Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire)\nGirl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire\n(Mist in your eyes from a distant fire)\nGirl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a dis\nA distant fireEmbed"
