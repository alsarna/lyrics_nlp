You are surrounded\nGive yourself up.\"\nIndiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there\n\"This is the police. You are surrounded\nGive yourself up.\"\nIndiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there\n\"This is the police. You are surrounded\nGive yourself up.\"\nIndiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there\nIndiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there\nIndiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there\nIndiana wants me, Lord I can't go back thereEmbed"
