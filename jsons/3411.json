    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere was a time when\nBroken hearts and broken dreams\nWere over\nThere was a place where\nAll you could do was\nWish on a four leaf clover\n\nBut now is a new time\nThere is a new place\nWhere dreams just can't come true\nIt started the day when I left you\n\n[Chorus]\nI could never love again the way that I loved you\nI could never cry again like I did when I left you\nAnd when we said goodbye\nOh the look in your eyes\nJust left me beside myself without your heart\n(Without your heart)\nI could never love again now that we're apart\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I was sorry\nIt was too late to turn around\nAnd tell you so\nThere was no reason\nThere was no reason\nJust a foolish beat of my heart\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody\nDon't you see the tears are falling down my face?\nSince you went away\nBreak my heart, you slipped away\nDidn't know I was wrong\nNever meant to hurt you now you're gone\n\nI could never love again now that we're apart\n(Now that we're apart)\nI could never love again now that we're apart"
