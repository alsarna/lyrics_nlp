    "lyrics": "A candy-colored clown they call the sandman\nTiptoes to my room every night\nJust to sprinkle stardust and to whisper\n\"Go to sleep. Everything is all right.\"\n\nI close my eyes, then I drift away\nInto the magic night, I softly say\nA silent prayer like dreamers do\nThen I fall asleep to dreams, my dreams of you\n\nIn dreams I walk with you, in dreams I talk to you\nIn dreams you're mine, all of the time\nWe're together in dreams, in dreams\n\nBut just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone\nI can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry\nI remember that you said goodbye\n\nIt's too bad that all these things\nCan only happen in my dreams\nOnly in dreams, in beautiful dreams"
