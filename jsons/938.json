    "lyrics": "In Dreams Lyrics[Intro]\nA candy-colored clown they call the sandman\nTiptoes to my room every night\nJust to sprinkle stardust and to whisper\n\"Go to sleep, everything is alright\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nI close my eyes, then I drift away\nInto the magic night, I softly say\nA silent prayer like dreamers do\nThen I fall asleep to dreams, my dreams of you\n\n[Chorus]\nIn dreams, I walk with you\nIn dreams, I talk to you\nIn dreams, you're mine all of the time\nWe're together in dreams, in dreams\n[Post-Chorus]\nBut just before the dawn\nI awake and find you gone\nI can't help it, I can't help it if I cry\nI remember that you said goodbye\n\n[Outro]\nIt's too bad that all these things\nCan only happen in my dreams\nOnly in dreams\nIn beautiful dreams3Embed"
