    "lyrics": "[Intro: Music Video Only]\nI'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou get your hands in it\nPlant your roots in it\nDusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)\nYou write her name on it\nSpin your tires on it\nBuild your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)\nYou bet your life on it, yeah\nIt's that...\n\n[Chorus]\nElm shade, red rust clay you grew up on\nThat plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on\nThat post game party field you circle up on\nAnd when it rains you get stuck on\nDrift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up\nAnd mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up\nHer blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts\nMakes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt\n\n[Music Video Interlude 1]\nRosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay\n[Verse 2]\nYou've mixed some sweat with it\nTaking a shovel to it\nYou've stuck some crosses and some painted\nGoal posts through it (Dirt)\nYou know you came from it (Dirt)\nAnd some day you'll return to...\n\n[Chorus ]\nElm shade, red rust clay you grew up on\nThat plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on\nThat post game party field you circle up on\nAnd when it rains you get stuck on\nDrift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up\nAnd mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up\nHer blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts\nMakes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt\n\n[Music Video Interlude 2]\nI asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said \"the world comes right to my window every day\"... Even if it's broken\n(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)\n\n[Chorus]\nElm shade, red rust clay you grew up on\nThat plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on\nThat post game party field you circle up on\nAnd when it rains, you get stuck on\nDrift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up\nAnd mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up\nHer blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts\nMakes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt\n[Post-Chorus]\nMakes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt\n\n[Music Video Interlude 3]\nSee Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen\n\n[Outro]\n(You know you came from it\nAnd some day, you'll return to it)"
