(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Miss Bad Media Karma\nAnother day, another drama\nGuess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama\nAnd with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner\nYou want a piece of me?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shameless'\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'Extra! Extra! This Just In'\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin'\n(You want a piece of me?)\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, yeah\nOh, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'\nTrying, and pissing me off\nWell, get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off\nHoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court\nNow, are you sure you want a piece of me?\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Strippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries'\nNow, for real, are you kiddin' me?\nNo wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please\nDo you want a piece of me?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm Mrs. 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shameless'\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'Extra! Extra! This Just In'\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin'\n(You want a piece of me?)\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, yeah\nOh, yeah\nOh, yeah\n\n[Breakdown]\nI'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17\nDon't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines\nThey're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazines\nYou want a piece of me?\nYou want a piece, piece of me?\nOh, yeah\nYou want a piece of me? Me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm Mrs. 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shameless'\n(You want a piece of me?)\nI'm Mrs. 'Extra! Extra!
