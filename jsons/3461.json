How does it feel when it's love?\nIt's just something you feel together\nWhen it's love\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou look at every face in a crowd\nSome shine and some keep you guessing\nWaiting for someone to come into focus\nTeach you your final love lesson\n[Chorus]\nHow do I know when it's love?\nI can't tell you but it lasts forever\nOh! How does it feel when it's love?\nIt's just something you feel together\n\n[Bridge]\n(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, when it's love\n(Oh oh oh oh) You can feel it, yeah!\n(Oh oh oh oh) Nothing's missing, yeah!\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge 2]\n(Oh oh oh oh) Yeah, you can feel it\n(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, when it's love\n(Oh oh oh oh) When nothing's missing, ow!\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I know when it's love?\nI can't tell you but it lasts forever\nOoh, how does it feel when it's love?\nIt's just something you feel together, hey!\nHow do I know when it's love?\nI can't tell you but it lasts forever\nWhen it's love ooh, when it's love\nHey! It'll last forever\n[Outro]\n(Na na na-ah na na)\nWhen it's love\n(Na na na-ah na na)\n(Na na na-ah na na)\n(Na na na-ah na na)\nYou and I, we're gonna feel this thing together\n(Na na na-ah na na)\nWhen it's love, ooh\nWhen it's love, baby\nYou can feel it, yeah!\nWe'll make it last forever\nOoh-ooh, when it's love1Embed"
