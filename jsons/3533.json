    "lyrics": "Satisfied LyricsYeah, yeah\nWhoa\n\nWe work our bodies weary\nTo stay alive\nThere must be more to living\nThan nine to five\n\nWhy should we wait for some better time?\nThere may not even be a tomorrow\nAin't no sense in losing your mind\nI'm gonna make it worth the ride\n\nDon't you know\nI won't give up until I'm satisfied?\nDon't you know\nWhy should I stop until I'm satisfied?\nIgnore the hesitation\nThat ties your hands\nUse your imagination\nAnd take a chance\n\nWon't let my moment of truth pass me by\nI've gotta make my move, now or never\nAnd if they turn me loose on this town\nThey're gonna have to hold me down\n\nDon't you know\nI won't give up until I'm satisfied?\nDon't you know\nWhy should I stop until I'm satisfied?\nYeah\n\nDon't you know\nAin't gonna stop up until we're satisfied?\nDon't you know\nWe shouldn't stop until we're satisfied?\nYeh, yeah\n\nDon't you know\nAin't gonna stop until I'm satisfied? Yeah\nDon't you know\nWe won't give up until we're satisfied?\nOh, oh, oh\nWhy should I stop before I'm satisfied? OwEmbed"
