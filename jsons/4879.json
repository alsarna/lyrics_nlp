Lyrics[Verse 1:]\nHe was a six foot stallion\nSaid a storybook thug\nHe was the kind\nThat made you wonder how he put down the love\nHe had a hickey in his pocket\nA phat rock in his ear\nHe made my heart stop pulpitating\nEvery time he came near\nHe has a spanking new Range for that tight wardrobe\nHis pants was saggin\nHe was plaided\nAnd his head was cornrows\nHe has his wrists bling-blinging\nAnd his long legs was bow\nHe tried to push up on me\nBut I knew he had me at go\n\n[Chorus x2:]\nI do\nI wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes\nI entice you\nSo come on, shorty\nIf you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playa\nBalling out of control\n\n[Verse 2:]\nMe and my crew started grooving\nMade our way to the floor\nIt's time to activate my plan\nAnd give this hottie a show\nI shook my hips\nTook a dip\nRoll my tongue 'cross my lips\nAnd when he took his place to dance wit me\nI felt fingertips on the small of my back\nSo I had to react like I was playing hard to get\nAnd told that boy to step back\nBut when I looked deep in his eyes\nAll I could see was his soul\nI'm 'bout to make this guy my man\nThat I can tell you\nFa 'sho\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Bridge x2:]\nWatch me\nDrop, drop\nShake it\nFor the fellas who know\nWatch me pop\nPop my hips\nAs I dip and roll\nWatch me stop\nStop traffic as I walk through the room\nKnowing all the papi's want me\nBut all I want is you\n[Repeat Chorus x4:]2Embed"
