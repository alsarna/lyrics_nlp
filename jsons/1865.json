    "lyrics": "Don't Say You Don't Remember\nBeverly Bremers\nWritten by Estelle Levitt and Helen Miller\n- peaked at #15 in 1972\nWe wrote on the corner of the table:\n\"This is the only one that will last\nFor you, for me, for always\nForever was meant for us\", but for us it went by too fast\nDon't say you don't remember\nI'll never love anyone else\nIf you say you don't remember\nHow can I go on living\n(How can I go on living)\nWith myself?\nWhen we meet you always call me \"baby.\"\nHow could it be that you forgot my name?\nBefore you go, be honest\nI belonged to you and believed that you felt the same\nDon't say you don't remember\nI'll never love anyone else\nIf you say you don't remember\nHow can I go on living\n(How can I go on living)\nWith myself?\nPeople never stay the same forever\nSomebody always loves a little more\nTonight I need to love you\nTogether we'll find a way to make tomorrow worth living for\nDon't say you don't remember\nI'll never love anyone else\nIf you say you don't remember\nHow can I go on living\n(How can I go on living)\nWith myself"
