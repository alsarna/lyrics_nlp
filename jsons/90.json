    "lyrics": "Whenever we kiss\nI worry and wonder\nYour lips may be near\nBut where is your heart\nIt's always like this\nI worry and wonder\nYou're close to me here\nBut where is your heart\nIt's a sad thing to realise\nThat you've a heart\nThat never melts\nWhen we kiss\nDo you close your eyes\nPretending that I'm someone else\nI must break the spell\nThis cloud that I'm under\nSo please won't you tell\nDarling where is your heart"
