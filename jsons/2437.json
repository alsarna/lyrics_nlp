    "lyrics": "I heard the weatherman\nPredict a sunny day\nHe did not mean to lie\nI look outside it's raining anyway\nI guess I can live with a rainy day\n\nCause in the scheme of things\nYou're bound lose a few\nEven your best-made plans\nBefore you know it, they are falling through\nBut that couldn't happen to me oooh and you\n\nThis time I'm in it for love\nThis time I'm in it to win\nIt's crazy to do it again\nBut how could I possibly lose\nHow could I lose\nThis time I'm in it for you\n\nMy Ma she used to say\nBeware the tender trap\nIf you get caught in one\nBe sure you notice where your heart is at\nDon't take chances with things\nThings like that, oh, oh\nThis time I'm in it for love\nThis time I'm in it to win\nIt's crazy to do it again\nBut how could I possibly lose\nHow could I lose\nThis time I'm in it for you\n\nThis time I'm in it for love\nBaby, this time I'm in it to win\nIt's crazy to do it again\nBut how could I possibly lose\nHow could I lose\nThis time I'm in it for you\n\nThis time I'm in it for love\nThis time I'm in it to win\nIt's crazy to do it again\nCrazy, baby\nBut how could I possibly lose\nAin't no way I could I lose\nThis time I'm in it for you\n\nThis time I'm in it for love"
