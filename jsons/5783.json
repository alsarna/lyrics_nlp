Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\n\n[Verse 1: Adam Levine]\nYeah, I, I know it's hard to remember\nThe people we used to be\nIt's even harder to picture\nThat you're not here next to me\nYou say it's too late to make it\nBut is it too late to try?\nAnd in our time that you wasted\nAll of our bridges burned down\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI've wasted my nights\nYou turned out the lights\nNow I'm paralyzed\nStill stuck in that time\nWhen we called it \"Love\"\nBut even the sun\nSets in paradise\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI'm at a payphone, trying to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\n[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nIf \"happy ever after\" did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAll those fairytales are full of shit\nOne more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh\n\n[Verse 2: Adam Levine]\nYou turned your back on tomorrow\n'Cause you forgot yesterday\nI gave you my love to borrow\nBut you just gave it away\nYou can't expect me to be fine\nI don't expect you to care\nI know I said it before\nBut all of our bridges burned down\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI've wasted my nights\nYou turned out the lights\nNow I'm paralyzed\nStill stuck in that time\nWhen we called it \"Love\"\nBut even the sun\nSets in paradise\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI'm at a payphone, trying to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two? (yeah)\n[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Wiz Khalifa]\nIf \"happy ever after\" did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAnd all those fairytales are full of shit\nOne more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Uh)\nNow, I'm at a payphone\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]\nMan, fuck that shit\nI'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round\nWondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing\nMade it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'\nAnd all of my cars start with the push of a button\nTelling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it\nSwitched the number to my phone so you never could call it\nDon't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'\nSwish, what a shame, coulda got picked\nHad a really good game, but you missed your last shot\nSo you talk about who you see at the top\nOr what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for\nPhantom pulled up, valet open doors\nWished I'd go away, got what you was looking for\nNow it's me who they want\nSo you can go take that little piece of shit with you\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI'm at a payphone, trying to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two? (For two?)\n(Yeah)\n[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nIf \"happy ever after\" did exist\nI would still be holding you like this\nAnd all these fairytales are full of shit\nOne more fucking love song, I'll be sick\nNow, I'm at a payphone"
