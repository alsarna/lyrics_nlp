    "lyrics": "Why'd you tell me this\nWere you looking for my reaction\nWhat do you need to know\nDon't you know I'll always be your girl\n\nYou don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers\nI've got loving eyes\nOf my own\n\nYou belong to me\n(Tell her you were fooling)\nYou belong to me\n(You don't even know her)\nYou belong to me\n(Tell her that I love you)\nYou belong to me\n\nYou belong to me\nCan it be, honey, that you're not sure\n\nYou belong to me\nThought we'd closed the book\nLocked the door\n\nYou don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers\nI've got loving eyes of my own, of my own\nAnd I can tell, I can tell darling\nYou belong to me\n(Tell her, tell her that I love you)\nYou belong to me\n(You belong, you belong, you belong to me)\nYou belong to me\nYou belong to me\n\nYou belong to me\n(Tell her, tell her)\nYou belong to me\n(I've known you from a long time ago, baby)\nYou belong to me\n(Don't leave me to go to her now)\nYou belong to me"
