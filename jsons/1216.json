    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt makes no difference if you're rich or poor\nOr if you're smart or dumb\nA woman's place in this old world\nIs under some man's thumb\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if you're born a woman\nYou're born to be hurt\nYou're born to be stepped on\nLied to, cheated on and treated like dirt\nAh, if you're born a woman\nYou're born to be hurt\n\n[Verse 3]\nA woman's lot is to give and give\nAnd go on givin'\nA woman's got to love and lose\nAnd go on livin'\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, I was born a woman\nI didn't have no say\nAnd when my man finally comes home\nHe makes me glad it happened that way\nBecause to be his woman\nNo price is too great to pay\n[Outro]\nYes, I was born a woman\nI'm glad it happened that way\nOh, I was born a woman"
