    "lyrics": "Everything Your Heart Desires LyricsYou say you can't stand to be tied so close to a lover\nOoh, you feel like a prisoner\nAnd you wanna find someone who will let you out\n\nCan't you see the heartbeat that you know so well\nIs better than some strange one you're looking for\nSay, you never know that strange one\nJust might be me, yeah\n\nCan't you see you have everything your heart desires\nSo why you want more?\nIf you have (if you have), everything your heart desired\nWould you still want more?\nYou have everything your heart desires\nWhy do you want more?\n(If you have)\nEverything your heart desires\nWould you still want more?\nYou tell me your best friend's world seem beautiful\nBut don't be fooled\nIt's nice work if you can get it\nYeah, what goes on behind closed doors you don't know\nMaybe she cries herself to sleep every night\n\nSorry that the heartbeat that she knows so well\nAin't what she's looking for\nYou never know that strange heart\nJust might be me\n\nBaby, you have everything your heart desires\nSo why you want more?\nIf you have (if you have), everything your heart desired\nWould you still want more?\nYou have, oh, everything your heart desires\nWhy do you want more?\n(If you have)\nEverything your heart desires\nWould you still want more?\n\nMaybe you'll confess; girl, you'll see\nIf you want the world, if you want the world, think of me\nNo words can help, so don't be sad, oh no\n'Cause baby, what you want is what you have\nYeah, hey...\nDo you still want me?\n\n(You have everything your heart desires)\nEverything your heart desires\nSo why you want more?\n(If you have everything your heart desires)\nI can give you anything you want\n(You have everything your heart desires)\nAs long as you know, I got what you need\nYou got the key, ooh baby\n(If you have everything your heart desired)\nI ain't gonna let you go\nNo no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no...\n(You had everything your heart desired...)Embed"
