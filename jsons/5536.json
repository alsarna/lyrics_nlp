(Oh-oh-oh)\nA battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)\nA battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)\nWhy does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh-oh)\nA battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)\nA battlefield (Oh-oh-oh)\nWhy does love always feel like...\n[Verse 2]\nCan't swallow our pride, neither of us wanna raise that flag, mmm\nIf we can't surrender, then we both gonna lose what we had, oh no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBoth hands tied behind my back for nothing (Nothing)\nOh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again\nI don't wanna fall for it now\n\n[Chorus]\nI never meant to start a war\nYou know I never wanna hurt you\nDon't even know what we're fighting for\nWhy does love always feel like a battlefield?
