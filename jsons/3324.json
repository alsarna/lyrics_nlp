I'll wait for you\nYou know how I feel, I won't stop until I hear your voice saying, \"I do\" (\"I do\")\nThis thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong\nWell, my life ain't worth living, if I can't be with you\n\n[Chorus: Michael & Both]\nI just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you\n(Oh, oh, and it feels)\nAnd if I stop, then tell me just what will I do\n(Uh-huh)\nI just can't stop loving you\n\n[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]\nWe can change all the world tomorrow\nWe can sing songs of yesterday\nI can say, \"Hey, Farewell\" to sorrow\nThis is my life and I want to see you for always\n\n[Chorus: Both]\nI just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you\n(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)\nAnd if I stop, then tell me just what will I do\n(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)\nI just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you\n(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)\nAnd if I stop, then tell me just what will I do\n(Oh, oh) (Oh, woah-woah!)13Embed"
