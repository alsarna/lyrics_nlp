    "lyrics": "Summer came and left without a warning\nAll at once I looked and you were gone\nAnd now you're looking back at me\nSearching for a way that we can be like we were before\n\nNow I'm back to what I knew before you\nSomehow the city doesn't look the same\nI'd give my life for one more night\nOf having you here to hold me tight; oh, please\nTake me there again\nOh, oh\n\nAnd I remember how you loved me\nTime was all we had until the day we said goodbye\nI remember every moment of those endless summer nights\n\nI still recall the walks along the beaches\nAnd the way your hair would glisten in the sun\nRising in the afternoon\nMaking love to you under the moon, oh\n\nDo you remember all the nights we spent in silence\nEvery single breath you took was mine\nWe can have it all again\nSay that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine\nOh, oh\nChorus\n\nThere's only so much I can say\nSo please don't run away from what we have together\nIt's only you and me tonight\nSo let's stay lost in flight\nOh, won't you please surrender\n\nChorus out"
