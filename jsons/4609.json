Chasez]\nBaby, what's the deal?\nWould I be too forward if\nI told you how I feel\nThat's just the way I do my thing\nI'm so for real\nAre you feeling my Timb's, my baggy jeans?\nMy thug appeal?\nDo you like it when a man can keep it real?\nOh\n\n[Chorus: Natina (J.C. Chasez)]\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (bring it all, bring it all)\nBut I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (diamond rings)\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (oh)\nGimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh baby)\n\n[Bridge (Part 1): Shamari]\nOh, I'll put my pride to the side\nJust to tell you how good\nYou make me feel inside\n\n[Bridge: (Part 2): J.C. Chasez]\nThere's not a single question\nThat we can't make this right\nCause it's you I need\nEvery day and night\nOh baby\n[Chorus: Natina (J.C./Shamari)]\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (bring it all, bring it all/yeah yeah)\nBut I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (no I don't)\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (bring it all/ooh oh)\nGimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh/ooh)\n\n[Chorus: Natina (Shamari)]\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (yeah)\nBut I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (oh)\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (bring it all, bring it all)\nGimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh woah)\n\n[Chorus: Natina (Shamari)]\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (bring it all)\nBut I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (ooh)\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (oh baby)\nGimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (bring it all)\n\n[Chorus: Natina (Shamari)]\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (oh)\nBut I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (diamond rings baby)\nOh, baby\nBring it all to me (yeah)\nGimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh)3Embed"
