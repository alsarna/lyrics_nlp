Mmm...\nAll of your friends think I'm just too young for you\nSo tell 'em I can do what girls their age can do. Oh babe...\n\nLet me love you down, even if it takes all night\nLet me love you down, you know it's got to be so right\nLet me love you down, even if it takes all night\nLet me love you down, you know it's got to be so right. Oh...\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt never really mattered too much to me\nThat they were just too damned blind to see\nAs long as I can love you down baby just be my man\nThat's all that mattered to me\n[Chorus]\nLet me love you down, even if it takes all night\nLet me love you down, you know it's got to be so right\nLet me love you down, ooh...\nLet me love you down, I know, I know, I could\n\n[Outro]\nLove you, down, down, ooh...\nLove you down, down, know, know, know\nKnow, know, know, know\nLet me love you, I wanna love you, down\nLet me love you, I wanna love you, down baby"
