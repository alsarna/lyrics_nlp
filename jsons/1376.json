    "lyrics": "I see you standing in the alleys and the hallways\n(Wait a second)\nYou're gone now\nI run to touch you, but you vanish through the doorway\nAnd, oh, how\nHard it is to live without you\nI love everything about you\nNow I know you're really gone\nBut my imagination is so strong\nThat I see you coming into view\nAnd your face is telling me that you\nOh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side\nOh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time\n(Wait a second)\n\nMirage, that's all you are to me\nMirage, something I only see\n\nSo I keep walking through the alleys and the hallways\nWhere are you?\nI keep remembering the kissing in the doorways\nThe car, too\nHow it all comes back to me\nThe movies every Saturday\nThe place we used to go to eat\nI want so much to have it like it used to be\nThat I see you coming into view\nAnd your face is telling me that you\nOh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side\nOh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time\n(Here it comes again)\nMirage, that's all you are to me\nMirage, something I only see\n\nJust a mirage, that's all you are to me\nJust a mirage, something that I only see\nJust a mirage, that's all you are to me\nJust a mirage, something that I only see"
