    "lyrics": "Life goes on day after day\nHearts torn in every way\n\nSo ferry 'cross the Mersey\nCause this land's the place I love\nAnd here I'll stay\n\nPeople they rush everywhere\nEach with their own secret care\n\nSo ferry 'cross the Mersey\nAnd always take me there\nThe place I love\n\nPeople around every corner\nThey seem to smile and say\nWe don't care what your name is boy\nWe'll never turn you away\n\nSo I'll continue to say\nHere I always will stay\n\nSo ferry 'cross the Mersey\nCause this land's the place I love\nAnd here I'll stay\nAnd here I'll stay\nHere I'll stay"
