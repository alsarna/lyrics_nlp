    "lyrics": "I can see, no matter how near you'll be\nYou'll never belong to me\nBut I can dream, can't I?\nCan't I pretend that I'm locked in the bend of your embrace\nFor dreams are just like wine and I am drunk with mine\n\nI'm aware my heart is a sad affair\nThere's much dis-illusion there\nBut I can dream, can't I?\nCan I adore you although we are oceans apart?\nI can't make you open your heart\nBut I can dream, can't I?\n\nI'm aware my heart is a sad affair\nThere's much dis-illusion there\nBut I can dream, can't I?\nCan't I adore you although we are oceans apart?\nI can't make you open your heart\nBut I can dream, \"Can't I?\"\nI can dream, \"Can't I?"
