    "lyrics": "Love Potion Number Nine LyricsI took my troubles down to Madame Ruth\nYou know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth\nShe's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine\nSellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine\nI told her that I was a flop with chicks\nI'd been this way since 1956\nShe looked at my palm and she made a magic sign\nShe said, \"What you need is Love Potion Number Nine\"\nShe bent down and turned around and gave me a wink\nShe said, \"I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink\"\nIt smelled like turpentine, it looked like India ink\nI held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink\nI didn't know if it was day or night\nI started kissin' everything in sight\nBut when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine\nHe broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine\nI held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink\nI didn't know if it was day or night\nI started kissin' everything in sight\nBut when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine\nHe broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine\nLove Potion Number Nine, Love Potion Number Nine\nLove Potion Number Nine1Embed"
