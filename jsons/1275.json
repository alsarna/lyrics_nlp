Drop the cable!\nAye-aye, sir, aye-aye\nCaptain! Captain!\n\n[Verse 4: Ringo Starr & John Lennon]\nAs we live a life of ease\nEvery one of us (Every one of us) has all we need (Has all we need)\nSky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)\nIn our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha-ha!)\n\n[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]\nWe all live in a yellow submarine\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine\nWe all live in a yellow submarine\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine\nWe all live in a yellow submarine\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine28Embed"
