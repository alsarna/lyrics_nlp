Yeah-ey-yeah-ey-ey\n(The beat is yours forever\nThat's when rock and roll dreams come through)\n(The beat is yours forever\nThat's when rock and roll dreams come through)\n(The beat is yours forever\nThat's when rock and roll dreams come through)\n(The beat is yours forever\nThat's when rock and roll dreams come through)\n(The beat is yours forever\nThat's when rock and roll dreams come through)\n(The beat is yours forever\nThat's when rock and roll dreams come through)Embed"
