    "lyrics": "Night LyricsNight, here comes the night\nAnother night to dream about you\nNight, each lonely night\nThe only time I'm not without you\n\nOnce more, I feel your kisses\nOnce more, I know what bliss is\nComes dawn, my darling, you're gone\nBut you come back into my arms each night\n\nOnce more, I feel your kisses\nOnce more, I know what bliss is\nComes dawn, my darling, you're gone\nBut you come back into my arms each nightEmbed"
