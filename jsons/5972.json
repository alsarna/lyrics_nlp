    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, all the parties on the streets are talkin'\nStore front mannequins sleeping in the lights\nWe used to smoke while we were jay-walking\nLike it was your birthday every other Saturday night\nKnew the bands so we never payed our cover\nWrote our names on the bathroom tiles\nWe never dressed to impress all the others\nThey would let us in on our laid back kinda style\nBut boy, you know it's been a while\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't know why you don't take me downtown\nLike you got anywhere better to be\nYou talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round\nLike a good time tease\nI'm only counting on your cancellation\nWhen I should be counting on you at my door\nDid you forget about how we went around?\nI don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore\nOh, anymore\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got some platforms sitting in the corner\nThey wanna stroll on a city sidewalk\nI got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh\nBut you ain't getting uh-uh\nIf you don't come pick me up (Damn)\nShow me off (Wow)\nYou might be tired, but I'm not\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't know why you don't take me downtown\nLike you got anywhere better to be\nYou talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round\nLike a good time tease\nI'm only counting on your cancellation\nWhen I should be counting on you at my door\nDid you forget about how we went around?\nI don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't know why you don't take me downtown\nLike you got anywhere better to be\nTalk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round\nLike a good time tease\nI'm only counting on your cancellation\nWhen I should be counting on you at my door\nDid you forget about how we went around?\nI don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore\nOh, anymore\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, don't know why you don't take me downtown\nI don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore\nI just don't get it"
