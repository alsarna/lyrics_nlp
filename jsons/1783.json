    "lyrics": "No, I can't forget this evening\nOr your face as you were leaving\nBut I guess that's just the way the story goes\nYou always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\nYes, it shows\n\nNo, I can't forget tomorrow\nWhen I think of all my sorrow\nWhen I had you there, but then I let you go\nAnd now it's only fair that I should let you know\nWhat you should know\n\nI can't live if living is without you\nI can't live, I can't give anymore\nI can't live if living is without you\nI can't give, I can't give anymore\n\nWell, I can't forget this evening\nOr your face as you were leaving\nBut I guess that's just the way the story goes\nYou always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\nYes, it shows\n\nI can't live if living is without you\nI can't live, I can't give anymore\nI can't live if living is without you\nI can't live, I can't give anymore\nIf living is without you"
