I made, I made a mistake\nPlease just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay\n'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you\nI'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake\nPlease just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay\n'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you\n[Verse 2]\nHow do I make you wanna stay?\nHate sleeping on my own, missing the way you taste\nNow I'm fucked up and I'm missing you\nHe'll never be like you\nStop looking at me with those eyes\nLike I could disappear and you wouldn't care why\nNow I'm fucked up and I'm missing you\nHe'll never be like you\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake\nPlease just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay\n'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you\nI'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake\nPlease just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay\n'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm falling on my knees, forgive me, I'm a fucking fool\nI'm begging, darling, please, absolve me of my sins, won't you?\nI'm falling on my knees, forgive me, I'm a fucking fool\nI'm begging, darling, please, absolve me of my sins, won't you?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake\nPlease just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay\n'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you\nI'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake\nPlease just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay\n'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you\n[Outro]\nBaby, baby, please believe me\nC'mon, take it easy\nPlease don't ever leave me, ooh\nHe'll never be like you67Embed"
