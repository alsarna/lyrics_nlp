    "lyrics": "[Verse]\nI hold you in my arms as the band plays\nWhat are those words whispered, baby, just as you turn away\nI saw you last night out on the edge of town\nI wanna read your mind to know just what I've got in this new thing I've found\n\n[Chorus]\nSo tell me what I see when I look in your eyes\nIs that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow\nI saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow\nWell I've tried so hard, baby, but I just can't see\nWhat a woman like you is doing with me\n\n[Chorus]\nSo tell me who I see when I look in your eyes\nIs that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?\n\n[Bridge]\nNow look at me, baby\nStruggling to do everything right\nAnd then it all falls apart\nWhen out go the lights\nI'm just a lonely pilgrim\nI walk this world in wealth\nI want to know if it's you I don't trust\n'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself\n[Verse 3]\nNow you play the loving woman, I'll play the faithful man\nBut just don't look too close into the palm of my hand\nWe stood at the altar, the gypsy swore our future was right\nBut come the wee wee hours, well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied\n\n[Chorus]\nSo when you look at me, you better look hard and look twice\nIs that me, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?\n\n[Verse 4]\nTonight our bed is cold\nI'm lost in the darkness of our love\nGod have mercy on the man\nWho doubts what he's sure of"
