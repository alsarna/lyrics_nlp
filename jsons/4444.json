Who wants to know?\nAre you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Link Wray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Jimmy Ray?\nWho wants to know? Who wants to know?\n\n[Verse 1]\nBaby, can you tell when you look in my eye\nYou don't mess around with me\n'Less you feelin' dangerous?\nAre you into my scene? Lay it on the line\nYou come and take a walk with me\nIf you're feelin' dangerous\nBecause I'm meaner, I'm leaner\nI ain't no in-betweener\nWith Aretha, I'm a dreamer\nGood God, I'm a believer\n[Chorus]\nAre you Johnnie Ray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Slim Ray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Fay Wray?\nWho wants to know? Who wants to know?\nAre you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Link Wray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Jimmy Ray?\nWho wants to know? Who wants to know 'bout me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, maybe we can shake it down by the walk\nDo you think I'm takin' liberties?\nAre you dangerous?\nI've gotta let it out, it's somethin' in my genes\nYou come and take a walk with me\nIf you're feelin' dangerous\nBecause I'm meaner, I'm leaner\nI ain't no in-betweener\nWith Aretha, I'm a dreamer\nGood God, I'm a believer\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you Johnnie Ray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Slim Ray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Fay Wray?\nWho wants to know? Who wants to know?\nAre you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know?)\nAre you Link Wray?
