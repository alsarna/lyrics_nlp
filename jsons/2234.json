    "lyrics": "I've had nothing but bad luck\nSince the day I saw the cat at my door\nSo I came into you, sweet lady\nAnswering your mystical call\n\nCrystal ball on the table\nShowing the future, the past\nSame cat with them evil eyes\nAnd I knew it was a spell she cast\n\nShe's just a devil woman\nWith evil on her mind\nBeware the devil woman\nShe's gonna get you\n\nShe's just a devil woman\nWith evil on her mind\nBeware the devil woman\nShe's gonna get you from behind\n\nGive me the ring on your finger\nLet me see the lines on your hand\nI can see me, a tall dark stranger\nGiving you what you hadn't planned\n\nI drank the potion she offered me\nI found myself on the floor\nThen I looked in those big green eyes\nAnd I wondered what I came there for\nShe's just a devil woman\nWith evil on her mind\nBeware the devil woman\nShe's gonna get you\n\nShe's just a devil woman\nWith evil on her mind\nBeware the devil woman\nShe's gonna get you from behind\n\nStay away\nLook out\n\nIf you're out on a moonlit night\nBe careful of them neighbourhood strays\nOf a lady with long black hair\nTryin' to win you with her feminine ways\n\nCrystal ball on the table\nShowing the future, the past\nSame cat with them evil eyes\nYou'd better get out of there fast\n\nShe's just a devil woman\nWith evil on her mind\nBeware the devil woman\nShe's gonna get you\n(repeats)"
