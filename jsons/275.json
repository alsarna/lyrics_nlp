The revolt in the\ndesert played a decisive part in the\nMiddle-Eastern Campaign.\n\nREPORTER\nYes, sir. But about Colonel Lawrence\nhimself?\n\nALLENBY\nNo, I didn't know him well, you know.\n\nREPORTER\nEh, Mr Bentley. You must know as much\nabout Colonel Lawrence as anybody does.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes. It was my privilege to know him, and\nto make him known to the world. He was a\npoet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior.\n\nREPORTER\nThank you.\nBENTLEY\nHe was also the most shameless\nexhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.\n\nMAN\nYou, sir. Who are you?\n\nBENTLEY\nMy name is Jackson Bentley.\n\nMAN\nWell, whoever you are, I overheard your\nlast remark and I take the gravest\npossible exception. He was a very great\nman.\n\nBENTLEY\nDid you know him?\n\nMAN\nNo, sir. I can't claim to have known him.\nI once had the honour to shake his hand\nin Damascus.\n\nMURRAY\nKnew him? No, I never knew him. He had\nsome minor function on my staff in Cairo.\n\n(Cairo)\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nMichael George Hartley. This is a nasty,\ndark little room.\n\nHARTLEY\nThat's right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe are not happy in it.\n\nHARTLEY\nI am. It's better than a nasty, dark\nlittle trench.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, you're a big noble fellow.\n\nHARTLEY\nThat's right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAh! Here is William Potter with my\nnewspaper.\n\nPOTTER\nHere you are, Tosh!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThanks. Would you care for one of\nCorporal Hartley's cigarettes?\n\nPOTTER\nTa. Is it there?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOf course. Headlines, but I bet it isn't\nmentioned in The Times. \"Bedouin tribes\nattack Turkish stronghold\", and I bet\nthat no one in this whole headquarters\neven knows it happened, or cared if it\ndid. Allow me to ignite your cigarette.\n\nMESSENGER\nSir. Mr Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes?\n\nFLIMSEY\nFlimsey, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThank you.\n\nHARTLEY\nYou'll do that once too often; it's only\nflesh and blood!\n\nLAWRENCE\nMichael George Hartley, you're a\nphilosopher.\n\nHARTLEY\nAnd you're balmy!\n\nPOTTER\nOw! It damn well hurts.\n\nLAWRENCE\nCertainly, it hurts!\n\nPOTTER\nWell, what's the trick then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe trick, William Potter, is not minding\nthat it hurts.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, by the way. If Captain Gibbon should\ninquire for me, tell him I've gone for a\nchat with the General.\n\nPOTTER\nHe's balmy!\n\nHARTLEY\nHe's all right.\n\n\nFREDDY\nLawrence!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes?\n\nFREDDY\nYou're supposed to be... Do you usually\nwear your cap in the mess?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, yes.\n\nFREDDY\nYou're supposed to be on duty, aren't\nyou? Where are you going?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMustn't talk shop, Freddy. Not in the\nmess. Matter of fact I'm going for a\n'powwow' with the General.\n\nFREDDY\nI'm not asking as a superior; I'm asking\nas the secretary of this mess. We don't\nwant chaps in here who should be on duty.\n\nORDERLY\nWhere are you going, please?\n\nFREDDY\nI must say! Lawrence!\n\nLAWRENCE\nSorry!\n\nFREDDY\nYou're a clown, Lawrence.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAh well, we can't all be lion-tamers...\nSorry!\n\nMURRAY\nIt's an intrigue, Dryden, and I do not\npropose to let an over-wheeling,\nfinicking, crass lieutenant thumb his\nnose at his general officer commanding\nand get away with it.\n\nDRYDEN\nHe doesn't sound as though he'd be any\ngreat loss, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nNow, don't try that, Dryden. There's a\nprinciple involved.\n\nDRYDEN\nThere is, indeed. He's of no use here in\nCairo; he might be in Arabia. He knows\nhis stuff, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nKnows the books, you mean. I've already\nsent out Colonel Brighton, who's a\nsoldier, and if Brighton thinks we should\nsend them some small arms, then we will.\nWhat more do you want?\n\nDRYDEN\nThere would be no question of Lieutenant\nLawrence giving military advice, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nBy God, I should hope not!\n\nDRYDEN\nIt's just that the Arab Bureau would like\nits own man on the spot, sir, to eh...\n\nMURRAY\nTo what?\n\nDRYDEN\n...to make our own appraisal of the\nsituation.\n\nMURRAY\nI may as well tell you it's my considered\nopinion, and that of my staff, that any\ntime spent on the Bedouin will be time\nwasted. They're a nation of sheep-\nstealers.\n\nDRYDEN\nThey did attack Medina.\n\nMURRAY\nWell, the Turks made mincemeat of them.\n\nDRYDEN\nWe don't know that, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nWe know they didn't take it. A storm in a\ntea-cup, Dryden; a side-show. Do you want\nmy own opinion? This whole theatre of\noperations is a side-show. The real war's\nbeing fought against the Germans, not the\nTurks, and not here but on the Western\nFront, in the trenches. Your Bedouin\narmy, or whatever it calls itself, would\nbe a side-show of a side-show.\n\nDRYDEN\nBig things have small beginnings, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nDoes the Arab Bureau want a 'big thing'\nin Arabia? If they rise against the\nTurks, does the Bureau think they're\ngoing to sit down quietly under us when\nthey're asked until this war's over?\n\nDRYDEN\nThe Bureau thinks the job at the moment,\nsir, is to win the war.\n\nMURRAY\nDon't tell me my duties, Dryden!\n\nOFFSCREEN\nLawrence, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nSend him in!\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood morning, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nSalute! If you're insubordinate of me,\nLawrence, I shall put you under arrest.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's my manner, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nYour what?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy manner, sir. It looks insubordinate,\nbut it isn't really.\n\nMURRAY\nNo, I can't make out whether you're\nbloody bad-mannered, or just half-witted.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have the same problem, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nShut up!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nNow, the Arab Bureau seem to think you\nwould be of some use to them in Arabia.\nWhy? I can't imagine! You don't seem able\nto perform your present duties properly.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI cannot fiddle, but I can make a great\nstate from a little city.\n\nMURRAY\nWhat!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThemistocles, sir. A Greek philosopher.\n\nMURRAY\nI know you've been well educated,\nLawrence. It says so in your dossier.\nYou're the kind of creature I can't\nstand, Lawrence, but I suppose I could be\nwrong. All right, Dryden, you can have\nhim for six weeks. Who knows? Might even\nmake a man of him. Come in. Yes? What is\nit, Hallon?\n\nHALLON\nNavy signal, sir. the convoy will be in\nPort Said tomorrow night.\n\nMURRAY\nIs that certain?\n\nHALLON\nYes, sir. There doesn't seem to be any\nartillery, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nBut there must be artillery!\n\nDRYDEN\nSir, this is something of an expedition.\nHe has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,\nfind the Arabs, and then get back. He\ncan't do that in six weeks.\n\nMURRAY\nTwo months, then.\n\nDRYDEN\nThree.\n\nMURRAY\nAll right. Three. Now, will you let me do\nsome work, Mr Dryden.\n\nDRYDEN\nThank you, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful\nfor this...\n\nMURRAY\nShut up and get out!\n\nLAWRENCE\nSir!\n\nMURRAY\nHow can I fight a bloody war without\nbloody artillery!\n\nLAWRENCE\nHow did you do it. sir?\n\nDRYDEN\nYou might better ask why I bothered to.\n\nLAWRENCE\nBecause I'm the man for the job.\n\nDRYDEN\nI just wonder about that\n\nLAWRENCE\nOf course I'm the man for the job. What\nis the job, by the way?\n\nDRYDEN\nFind Prince Feisal.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood. And when I've found him?\n\nDRYDEN\nFind out what kind of man he is; find out\nwhat his intentions are. I don't mean his\nimmediate intentions. That's of Colonel\nBrighton's business, not yours. I mean,\nhis intentions in Arabia altogether.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh! That's new. Where are they now?\n\nDRYDEN\nAnywhere within three hundred miles of\nMedina. They're Hasami Bedouins. They can\ncross sixty miles of desert in a day.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, thanks, Dryden. This is going to be\nfun.\n\nDRYDEN\nLawrence, only two kinds of creature get\nfun of the desert: Bedouins and gods, and\nyou're neither. Take it from me; for\nordinary men, it's a burning, fiery\nfurnace.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, Dryden. It's going to be fun.\n\nDRYDEN\nIt is recognised that you have a funny\nsense of fun.\nTAFAS\nHere, you may drink. One cup.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou do not drink?\n\nTAFAS\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll drink when you do.\n\nTAFAS\nI am Bedu.\n\n\nTAFAS\nTruly, now, you are a British Officer?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nTAFAS\nFrom Cairo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nTAFAS\nYou did not ride from Cairo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Thank Heavens. It's nine hundred\nmiles; I came by boat.\n\nTAFAS\nAnd before? From Britain?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nTAFAS\nTruly?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFrom Oxfordshire.\n\nTAFAS\nIs that a desert country?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo; a fat country; fat people.\n\nTAFAS\nYou are not fat?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. I'm different... Here, take it.\n\nTAFAS\nFirst, I take you to Lord Feisal, then\nyou give it to me.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTake it now.\n\nTAFAS\nBedu food.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood.\n\nTAFAS\nMore...Bedu!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhere?\n\nTAFAS\nFrom here to Lord Feisal's camp is Harif\ncountry.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, I know.\n\nTAFAS\nI am not Harif.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Hasimi of the Beni Salim.\n\nTAFAS\nPut the right foot in tight. Lock it with\nyour left foot. Then, when you're ready\nto go, hit her on the shoulder and say,\n'Hut, hut, hut!'\n\nLAWRENCE\nHut, hut, hut!\n\nTAFAS\nAh, today will be difficult, but tomorrow\ngood riding...  I think we reach Mastura\nWell tomorrow. Yes? And from Mastura Well\nto Lord Feisal's camp one day more. Now!\n\nAt the Harif Well\n\nTAFAS\nGood?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's all right.\n\nTAFAS\nThis is a Harif well. The Harif are a\ndirty people.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTurks?\n\nTAFAS\nBedu!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWho is he?... Tafas!\n\nALI\nHe's dead.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. Why?\n\nALI\nThis is my well.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have drunk from it.\n\nALI\nYou are welcome.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe was my friend.\n\nALI\nThat!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. That.\n\nALI\nThis pistol yours?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, his.\n\nALI\nHis?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMine.\n\nALI\nThen I will use it. Your friend was a\nHasami of the Beni Salim.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know.\n\nALI\nI am Ali of El Karish.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've heard of you.\n\nALI\nSo, what was a Hasami doing here?\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe was taking me to help Prince Feisal.\n\nALI\nYou have been sent from Cairo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALI\nI have been in Cairo for my schooling. I\ncan both read and write. My Lord Feisal\nalready has an Englishman.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALI\nWhat is your name?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy name is for my friends. None of my\nfriends is a murderer.\n\nALI\nYou are angry, English. He was nothing.\nThe well is everything. The Hasami may\nnot drink at our wells. He knew that.\nSalaam. Hut, hut, hut.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali. So long as the Arabs fight\ntribe against tribe, so long will they be\na little people; a silly people; greedy,\nbarbarous, and cruel, as you are.\n\nALI\nCome. I will take you to Feisal.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI do not want your company, Sherif.\n\nALI\nWadi Safra is another day from here. You\nwill not find it, and not finding it, you\nwill die.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI will find it with this.\n\nALI\nGood army compass. How if I take it?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen you would be a thief.\n\nALI\nHave you no fear, English?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy fear is my concern.\n\nALI\nTruly. God be with you, English.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nAs I walk along the Bois Bou-long,\nWith an independent air,\nYou can here the girls declare,\n'He must be a millionaire,\nYou can rum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum,\nTi-tuddely-tun-ti-tun-ti-tun,\nI'm the man who broke the bank at\nMonte Carlo.\n\nBRIGHTON\nHey! You!...  I've been waiting for you.\n\nLAWRENCE\nDid you know I was coming?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI knew someone was coming; Feisal told\nme.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHow did he know?\n\nBRIGHTON\nNot much happens within fifty miles of\nFeisal that Feisal doesn't know, I'll\ngive him that. No escort?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy guide was killed at the Matsra well.\n\nBRIGHTON\nTurks?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. An Arab.\n\nBRIGHTON\nBloody savages!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThis is Wadi Safra, isn't it?\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, they're over there; now, just a\nminute. What's your name and who sent\nyou?\n\nLAWRENCE\nLawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab\nBureau.\n\nBRIGHTON\nOh. and what are you to do for the Arab\nBureau?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, it's rather vague, sir. I'm to\nappreciate the situation.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, that won't be difficult. The\nsituation's bloody awful. The morale, if\never they had any, which I doubt, the\nTurks knocked out of them in front of\nMedina with howitzers. They're fading\naway by dozens every night. What I want\nto say to you is this; that wherever you\nare and whoever you're with, you're a\nBritish serving officer, and here's an\norder; when we get into that camp you're\nto keep your mouth shut. Do you\nunderstand what I'm saying?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, sir. I understand what you're\nsaying.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou'll make your appreciation and get\nback to...Oh my God; not again!... I've\ntold him; God knows I've told him. 'Move\nsouth', I've said, 'You're still in\nrange'. They simply will not understand\nwhat modern weapons do.\n\n\nFEISAL\nStand and fight! Stand and fight! Fire\nback at them!...  Who are you?\n\nBRIGHTON\nLieutenant Lawrence, sir. Seconded to the\nArab Bureau. This is a bloody mess, sir,\nwe'll have to move south.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, yes, Colonel; fifty miles south. You\nwere right and I was wrong. We must take\nsome thought for the wounded.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, we can take care of them at Yenbo,\nsir.\n\nFEISAL\nIf they get to Yenbo.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, they can hardly come with us, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nNo, they must try to reach Yenbo.\nLieutenant, eh..\n\nLAWRENCE\nLawrence.\n\nFEISAL\nYou understand, Lieutenant Lawrence, my\npeople are unused to explosives and\nmachines. First the guns, and now this.\n\n\nDAUD\nCigarette?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry.\n\nSOLDIER\nEh?\n\nDAUD\nCigarette, Your Excellency?\n\nSOLDIER\nHump off!\n\nDAUD\nPlease, Your Excellency. Just one for\ntwo?\n\nBRIGHTON\nHold it, Jenkins! Jenkins! Jenk...!\nJenkins!\n\nMAJID\n'Aurens?\n\nLAWRENCE\n'Aurens!\n\nMAJID\n'Aurens, you have no servant.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't need a servant.\n\nDAUD\nNo? We can do everything. Light fires;\ncook food; wash clothes.\n\nFERRAJ\nYes, everything.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't doubt it.\n\nDAUD\nIt will be very nice for you...\n\nLAWRENCE\nI can't afford it.\n\n\nSILIAM\nRecite, then, as much of the Koran as may\nbe easy to you. God knoweth that there be\nsome among you sick while others travel\nthrough the Earth in quest for the\nbounties of God; others do battle in his\ncause; recite, therefore, as much as may\nbe easy and observe the prayers; this\nwill be best and richest in the\nrecompense. Seek ye the forgiveness of\nGod; verily, God is forgiving, merciful.\n\nFEISAL\nGreetings, Ali.\n\nALI\nMy lord.\n\nBRIGHTON\nSherif Ali.\n\nFEISAL\nLieutenant Lawrence, you have met Sherif\nAli, I think.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, my lord.\n\nFEISAL\nAnd now, Siliam, the brightness.\n\nSILIAM\nBy the noon-day brightness, by the light\nwhen it darkeneth; thy Lord hath not\nforsaken thee; neither hath he been\ndispleased...\n\nFEISAL\n...and surely the future will be better\nfor thee than the past...\n\nLAWRENCE\n...And in the end shall your Lord be\nbounteous to thee and thou be satisfied.\n\nFEISAL\nSo...? Yes, Colonel?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI want a decision, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nYou want me to fall back on Yenbo.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, you're not doing much good here,\nsir. I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we\ncan't supply you here.\n\nFEISAL\nYou could supply us through Aqaba.\n\nBRIGHTON\nAqaba! Well, if you can get hold of\nAqaba, sir, of course we can supply you,\nbut you can't.\n\nFEISAL\nYou could.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou mean the Navy? The Turks have twelve-\ninch guns at Aqaba, sir; can you imagine\nwhat that means?\n\nFEISAL\nYes, I can imagine.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, put that out of your mind, sir. The\nNavy's got other things to do.\n\nFEISAL\nOh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.\n\nBRIGHTON\nThe one essential sector of this front is\nand must be the Canal. You can see that,\nsir, surely.\n\nFEISAL\nI see that the Canal is an essential\nBritish interest; it is of little\nconsequence to us.\n\nBRIGHTON\nI must ask you not to speak like that,\nsir. British and Arab interests are one\nand the same.\n\nFEISAL\nPossibly.\n\nALI\nHa! Ha!\n\nBRIGHTON\nUpon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.\nFall back on Yenbo and we will give you\nequipment; give you arms, advice,\ntraining, everything!\n\nFEISAL\nGuns?\n\nBRIGHTON\nA modern rifle for every man.\n\nFEISAL\nNo, guns! Artillery! Guns like the\nTurkish guns at Medina.\n\nALI\nYes. Give us guns and keep the training.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYour men need training far more then\nguns, sir.\n\nALI\nThe English will teach the Bedu to fight?\n\nBRIGHTON\nWe will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight\na modern, mechanised army.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, Lieutenant? What do you think about\nYenbo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI think it is far from Damascus.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWe'll have you in Damascus and never\nfear.\n\nFEISAL\nHave you been in Damascus, Mr Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, my lord.\n\nFEISAL\nIt is beautiful, is it not?\n\nLAWRENCE\nVery.\n\nBRIGHTON\nThat'll do, Lawrence. Dreaming won't get\nyou to Damascus, sir, but discipline\nwill. Look, sir, Great Britain is a small\ncountry; it's much smaller than yours; a\nsmall population compared with some; it's\nsmall but it's great, and why?\n\nALI\nBecause it has guns!\n\nBRIGHTON\nBecause it has discipline!\n\nFEISAL\nBecause it has a navy; because of this,\nthe English go where they please and\nstrike where they please and this makes\nthem great.\n\nLAWRENCE\nRight.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMr Lawrence, that will do! Lieutenant\nLawrence, sir, is not your military\nadviser.\n\nFEISAL\nBut I would like to hear his opinion.\n\nBRIGHTON\nDamn it, Lawrence! Who do you take your\norders from?\n\nSILIAM\nFrom Lord Feisal in Feisal's tent.\n\nALI\nOld fool! Why turn from him to him; they\nare master and man!\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy lord, I think... I think your book is\nright. The desert is an ocean in which no\noar is dipped and on this ocean the Bedu\ngo where they please and strike where\nthey please. This is the way the Bedu\nhave always fought. You're famed\nthroughout the world for fighting in this\nway and this is the way you should fight\nnow!\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, I don't know.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong. Fall\nback on Yenbo, sir, and the Arab Rising\nbecome's one poor unit in the British\nArmy.\n\nFEISAL\nWhat is this to you?\n\nBRIGHTON\nLawrence, do you know you're a traitor?\n\nFEISAL\nNo, no, Colonel, eh... he is a young man\nand young men are passionate, but they\nmust say their say, but wiser people must\ndecide, I know you are right.\n\nBRIGHTON\nVery well, sir, once we move; the sooner\nthe better, you'll lose another fifty men\ntonight.\n\nFEISAL\nYou tread heavily, but you speak the\ntruth. I will give you my answer\ntomorrow, now it is late... Colonel\nBrighton means to put my men under\nEuropean officers, does he not?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIn effect, my lord, yes.\n\nFEISAL\nAnd I must do it because the Turks have\nEuropean guns, but I fear to do it; upon\nmy soul, I do. The English have a great\nhunger for desolate places. I fear they\nhunger for Arabia\n\nFEISAL\nThen you must deny it to them.\n\nFEISAL\nYou are an Englishman. Are you not loyal\nto England?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTo England and to other things.\n\nFEISAL\nTo England and Arabia, both? And is that\npossible? I think you are another of\nthese desert-loving English. Doughty. Stanhope. Gordon of\nKhartoum. No Arab loves the desert. We\nlove water and green trees. There's\nnothing in the desert. No man needs\nnothing. Or is it that you think we are\nsomething you can play with? Because we\nare little people; a silly people;\ngreedy, and barbarous, and cruel. Do you\nknow, Lieutenant, in the Arab city of\nC¢rdoba were two miles of public lighting\nin the streets when London was a village?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, you were great.\n\nFEISAL\nNine centuries ago.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTime to be great again, my lord.\n\nFEISAL\nWhich is why my father made this war upon\nthe Turks. My father, Mr Lawrence, not\nthe English. But my father is old and\nI...I long for the vanished gardens of\nCordoba. However, before the gardens must\ncome the fighting. To be great again, it\nseems that we need the English, or...\n\nLAWRENCE\n...Or?\n\nFEISAL\nWhat no man can provide, Mr Lawrence. We\nneed a miracle.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nAqaba! Aqaba...from the land!\n\nALI\nYou are mad! To come to Aqaba by land we\nshould have to cross the Nefud Desert.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's right.\n\nALI\nThe Nefud cannot be crossed.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll cross it if you will.\n\nALI\nYou! It takes more than a compass,\nEnglishman. The Nefud is the worst place\nGod created.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI can't answer for the place, only for\nmyself. Fifty men?\n\nALI\nFifty! Against Aqaba?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIf fifty men came out of the Nefud, they\nwould be fifty men other men might join.\nThe Howitat are there, I hear.\n\nALI\nThe Howitat are brigands; they will sell\nthemselves to anyone.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood fighters, though.\n\nALI\nGood? Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot\nbe turned round. From the landward side\nthere are no guns at Aqaba.\n\nALI\nWith good reason. It cannot be approached\nfrom the landward side!\n\nLAWRENCE\nCertainly the Turks don't dream of it.\nAqaba is over there. It's only a matter\nof going.\n\nALI\nYou are mad!\n\n\nFEISAL\nAnd where are you going, lieutenant, with\nfifty of my men?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTo work your miracle.\n\nFEISAL\nBlasphemy is a bad beginning for such a\njourney.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWho told you?\n\nFEISAL\nAli did. Why not you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou are falling back on Yenbo, sir?\n\nALI\nYes. Yes, I must. But I will spare these\nto you. Did Ali break confidence to tell\nme?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my\nlord.\n\nFEISAL\nYet, you did not tell Colonel Brighton.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. But since you do know, we can claim\nto ride in the name of Feisal of Mecca.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim\nit, but in whose name do you ride?\n\n\nGASIM\nSherif! I caught them. They had tracked\nus. They were here. I caught them.\n\nALI\nWhy are you here? Boy!\n\nDOUD\nTo serve lord Aurens, Sherif.\n\nGASIM\nThis is true, Aurens. They do wish it.\n\nALI\nYou have been tracking us. You were told\nto stay.\n\nDOUD\nNo, Sherif. Our camel strayed; we\nfollowed her.\n\nFERRAJ\nShe led us here to be lord Aurens'\nservants. It is the Will of Allah.\n\nALI\nBlasphemy!\n\nLAWRENCE\nDon't do that!\n\nGASIM\nNo, no! Aurens. These are not servants.\nThese are outcasts. Parentless!\n\nALI\nBe warned! They are not suitable.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey sound very suitable. You can ride\nwith the baggage.\n\nALI\nThese are not servants. These are\nworshippers!\n\nFERRAJ\nAurens?\n\nLAWRENCE\nHm?\n\nFERRAJ\nOne shilling...every week.\n\nGASIM\nThat is fair.\n\nFERRAJ\nEach.\n\nGASIM\nNO! That is too much!\n\nLAWRENCE\nAlright.\n\nGASIM\nThey will be lucky for you. Allah favours\nthe compassionate.\n\n\nALI\nThere is the railway...and that is the\ndesert. From here until the other side;\nno water but what we carry: for the\ncamels; no water at all. If the camels\ndie, we die. And in twenty days they will\nstart to die.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere's no time to waste, then, is there?\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nI was thinking.\n\nALI\nYou were drifting.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. It will not happen again.\n\nALI\nBe warned! You were drifting.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt will not happen again!\n\n\nALI\nThat water is wasted. From now on we must\ntravel by night and rest while it is too\nhot to travel. A few hours each day.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy don't we start now?\n\nALI\nNo. We will rest now. Three hours.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFine. I'll wake you.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nDo we rest here?\n\nALI\nThere is no rest, now, short of water,\nAurens. On the other side of that.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd how much of that is there?\n\nALI\nI'm not sure, but however much it must be\ncrossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.\nThis is the Sun's Anvil.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nHave we done it?\n\nSILIAM\nNo! But we're off the Anvil.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThank God for that, anyway!\n\nSILIAM\nYes. Thank Him! Aurens, I do not think\nyou know how you have tempted him.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know. We've done it.\n\nALI\nGod willing.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhen do we reach the wells?\n\nALI\nGod willing, midday.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen we've done it.\n\nSILIAM\nThank Him, Aurens. Thank Him.\n\nDOUD\nAurens!\n\nALI\nGasim's!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat's happened to him?\n\nALI\nGod knows!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy don't you stop?\n\nALI\nFor what? He will be dead by midday!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe must go back.\n\nALI\nWhat for? To die with Gasim? In one hour\ncomes the sun. In God's name, understand!\nWe cannot go back!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI can! Take the boy!\n\nALI\nIf you go back, you kill yourself, is\nall! Gasim you have killed already.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGet out of my way!\n\nALI\nGasim's time is come, Aurens. It is\nwritten.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNothing is written!\n\nALI\nGo back, then! What did you bring us here\nfor with your blasphemous conceit! Hey?\nEnglish blasphemer! Aqaba? Was it Aqaba?\nYou will not be at Aqaba, English! Go\nback, blasphemer, but you will not be at\nAqaba!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI shall be at Aqaba; that is written...in\nhere.\n\nALI\nEnglish!!! English!!!\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nNothing is written.\n\nGASIM\nAurens?\n\nGASIM\nAurens?\n\nALI\nEl Aurens?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFerraj. Wash!\n\n\nALI\nFerraj. El Aurens, truly for some men\nnothing is written unless they write it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot 'El' Aurens; just Aurens.\n\nALI\nEl Aurens is better\n\nLAWRENCE\nTrue.\n\nALI\nYour father, too, just Mr Lawrence.\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy father is Sir Thomas Chapman.\n\nALI\nIs that a lord?\n\nLAWRENCE\nA kind of lord.\n\nALI\nAnd when he dies, you too will be a lord.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nALI\nAh, you have an elder brother.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nALI\nBut, then? I do not understand this. Your\nfather's name is Chapman...\n\nLAWRENCE\nAli, he didn't marry my mother.\n\nALI\nI see.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry.\n\nALI\nIt seems to me that you are free to\nchoose your own name, then.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. I suppose I am.\n\nALI\nEl Aurens is best.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAlright. I'll settle for 'El Aurens'.\n\n\nALI\nThey are the robes of a Sherif of the\nBeni Wadji.\n\nLAWRENCE\nVery fine. A great honour.\n\nONLOOKER\nThe honour is to us. Salaam, Sherif.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIs it permitted?\n\nALI\nSurely.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSalaam.\n\nCROWD\nSalaam.\n\nSILIAM\nHe for whom nothing is written may write\nhimself a                 , salaam.\n\nALI\nThey are good for riding. Try!\n\n\nAUDAR\nWhat are you doing, Englishman?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAs you see. Are you alone?\n\nAUDAR\nAlmost. Are you with that party of dogs\nwho are drinking at my well?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYours?\n\nAUDAR\nI am Audar Abu Tayi.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've heard of another man of that name.\n\nAUDAR\nOther? What other?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe Audar I'd heard of wouldn't need\nsomeone's help to look after his wells.\n\nAUDAR\nAh. He must be a great hero.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe is. He wouldn't refuse water to men\ncoming out of the great Nefud Desert.\n\nAUDAR\nNow, would he not? Hm. No, that must be\nsome other man. Here is my help.  Son,\nwhat fashion is this?\n\nSON\nHarif, father.\n\nAUDAR\nWhat manner of Harif?\n\nSON\nA Beni Wadji Sherif.\n\nAUDAR\nAnd is he Harif?\n\nSON\nNo, father. English!\n\nAUDAR\nSon! They are stealing our water; tell\nthem we're coming. Tell them!... Empty\nthat!\n\nALI\nDo not!!\n\nAUDAR\nIt is Audar of the Howitat who speaks.\n\nALI\nIt is Ali of the Harif who answers.\n\nAUDAR\nHarif? Ali, does your father still steal?\n\nALI\nNo. Does Audar take me for one of his own\nbastards?\n\nAUDAR\nNo, there is no resemblance. Alas, you\nresemble your father.\n\nALI\nAudar flatters me.\n\nAUDAR\nYou're easily flattered. I knew your\nfather well.\n\nALI\nDid you know your own?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAuda! We are fifty, you are two. How if\nwe shot you down?\n\nAUDAR\nWhy, then you have a blood feud with the\nHowitat. Do you desire it?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot the generals in Cairo, nor the Sultan\nhimself desire that. Call off your men.\n\nAUDAR\nNo, no, boy. This honours the unworthy.\nI've only just begun to teach him.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd what are you teaching him today?\nHowitat hospitality?\n\nAUDAR\nBe not clever with me, English! Who is\nhe?\n\nLAWRENCE\nA friend of Prince Feisal's.\n\nAUDAR\nOh. So, you desire my hospitality.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nAUDAR\nIs he your tongue?\n\nALI\nWe do desire it.\n\nAUDAR\nUgh. Then, it is given, if you will take\nit. I am at my summer camp; a poor place.\nWell, to me it seems a poor place. Some\nmen find it marvellous. Tomorrow, maybe,\nI will allow the Turks to buy you,\nfriends of Feisal. But, dine with me.\nDine with Auda, English; dine with the\nHowitat, Harif. It is my pleasure that\nyou dine with me in Wadi Ram.\n\nIn Auda's tent\n\nAUDAR\nThis thing you work against Aqaba, what\nprofit do you hope from it?\n\nALI\nWe work it for Feisal of Mecca. The Harif\ndo not work for profit.\n\nAUDAR\nWell, if a man was meant to be a servant,\nAli, he could find worse masters than\nFeisal, but I...I cannot serve.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.\n\nAUDAR\nYes, it is my pleasure.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe do not work this thing for Feisal.\n\nAUDAR\nNo? For the English, then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFor the Arabs.\n\nAUDAR\nThe Arabs. The Howitat, Ajili, Rala, Beni\nSaha; these I know, I have even heard of\nthe Harif, but the Arabs! What tribe is\nthat?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey're a tribe of slaves; they serve the\nTurks.\n\nAUDAR\nWell, they are nothing to me. My tribe is\nthe Howitat...\n\nALI\nWho work only for profit.\n\nAUDAR\nWho work at Auda's pleasure.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd Auda's pleasure is to serve the\nTurks.\n\nAUDAR\nServe. I serve?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt is the servant who takes money.\n\nAUDAR\nI am Audar Abu Tayi! Does Audar serve?\n\nCROWD\nNo!\n\nAUDAR\nDoes Audar Abu Tayi serve?\n\nCROWD\nNo!! Ha! Ha! Ha!\n\nAUDAR\nI carry twenty-three great wounds, all\ngot in battle. Seventy-five men have I\nkilled with my own hands in battle. I\nscatter, I burn my enemies tents. I take\naway their flocks and herds. The Turks\npay me a golden treasure. Yet, I am poor,\nbecause I  am a river to my people! Is\nthat service?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nSILIAM\nAnd yet now it seems Audar has grown old\nand lost his taste for fighting.\n\nAUDAR\nIt is well you say it in my tent, thou\nold tulip!\n\nALI\nYet, this is a tulip that the Turks could\nnot buy.\n\nAUDAR\nWhy should they wish to? Now! I will tell\nyou what they pay me, and you will tell\nme if this is a servant's wages. They pay\nme, month by month, one hundred golden\nguineas.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOne hundred and fifty, Auda.\n\nAUDAR\nWho told you that?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have long ears.\n\nAUDAR\nAnd a long tongue between them.\n\nLAWRENCE\nA hundred; a hundred and fifty; what\nmatters? It's a trifle...a trifle which\nthey take from a great box they have...\n\nALI\nIn Aqaba.\n\nAUDAR\nIn Aqaba!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhere else?\n\nAUDAR\nYou trouble me like women.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFriends, we have been foolish. Audar will\nnot come to Aqaba.\n\nAUDAR\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFor money.\n\nAUDAR\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFor Feisal?\n\nAUDAR\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNor to drive away the Turks. He will come\nbecause it is his pleasure.\n\nAUDAR\nThy mother mated with a scorpion.\n\n\nAUDAR\nMake God your agent! Aqaba!\n\nCROWD\nAqaba!\n\nAUDAR\nGod be with you.\n\n\nALI\nYes, Aqaba. Tomorrow, we will go and get\nit.\n\nLAWRENCE\nDo you think we shall?\n\nALI\nYes. If you're right about the guns.\n\n\nAUDAR\nHe killed: he dies.\n\nALI\nThis is the end of Aqaba.\n\nSILIAM\nOne of our men murdered one of Auda's\nmen.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy?\n\nSILIAM\nTheft? Blood-feud? It makes no matter\nwhy.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAli!\n\nALI\nIt is an ancient wound.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI didn't come here to watch a tribal\nbloodbath.\n\nAUDAR\nIt is the law, Aurens.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe Law says the man must die.\n\nAUDAR\nHm!\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt he dies, would that content the\nHowitat?\n\nAUDAR\nYes.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali. If none of lord Auda's men\nharms any of yours, will that content the\nHarif?\n\nALI\nYes.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, I will execute the Law. I have no\ntribe and no one is offended. Gasim! Did\nyou do it?\n\nAUDAR\nWell. Aurens. What ails the Englishman?\n\nALI\nThat man he killed was the man he brought\nout of the Nefud.\n\nAUDAR\nAh, it was written, then. Better to have\nleft him.\n\nALI\nIt was execution, Aurens: no shame in\nthat. Besides, it was necessary. You gave\nlife and you took it. The writing is\nstill yours.\n\nOn the beach at Aqaba\n\nALI\nThe miracle is accomplished. Garlands for\nthe conqueror. Tribute for the prince;\nflowers for the man.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm none of those things, Ali.\n\nALI\nWhat, then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nDon't know. Thanks. My God I love this\ncountry. What!\n\nAUDAR\nNo gold in Aqaba!\n\nMAN\nI've found it!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's a pity. Ali. You get a message\ndown the coast to Yenbo. Tell Feisal to\nfind boats...any boats, and bring the\nArab army here to Aqaba quickly.\n\nALI\nAnd you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm going to tell the generals in Cairo.\nYes, cross Sinai. Come on!\n\nALI\nSinai!?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes!\n\nALI\nWith these?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey'll be alright with me. Look, Ali. If\nany of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and\nsaid, 'We've taken Aqaba. the generals\nwould laugh.\n\nALI\nI see. In Cairo you will put off these\nfunny clothes. You will wear trousers and\ntell stories of our quaintness and\nbarbarity, and then, they will believe\nyou.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou're an ignorant man.\n\nAUDAR\nPaper! Paper! There is no gold in Aqaba.\nNo gold! No great box!\n\nLAWRENCE\nDid Audar come to Aqaba for gold?\n\nAUDAR\nFor my pleasure as you said, but gold is\nhonourable, and Aurens promised gold.\nAurens lied.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSee, Auda. The Crown of England promises\nto pay five thousand golden guineas\nto Audar Abu Tayi, signed in His\nMajesty's absence, by...me. In ten days,\nI'll be back with the gold. With gold,\nwith guns, ...with everything.\n\nAUDAR\nTen days. You'll cross Sinai?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy not? Moses did.\n\nAUDAR\nAnd you will take the children?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMoses did!\n\nAUDAR\nMoses was a prophet and beloved of God.\nHe said there was gold here: he lied. He\nis not perfect.\n\n\nFERRAJ\nLord, can we not rest?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI told you, 'No rest till they know I\nhold Aqaba'. Have you two slept in beds?\nFerraj? Doud? With sheets. Tomorrow the\nfinest sheets in the finest room in the\nfinest hotel in Cairo, I promise.\n\nMAJID\nThen it shall be so, lord.\n\nLAWRENCE\nLook! a pillar of fire.\n\nDOUD\nNo, lord. Dust.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy compass! No matter. If we ride west,\nwe must strike the Canal...\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nCome on!\n\n\nDOUD\nAurens!! Aurens!!\n\nFERRAJ\nAurens!\n\nLAWRENCE\nFerraj! Ferraj! Don't! Don't! Don't!\n\n\nFERRAJ\nAurens? Why do you walk? But why, lord?\nAurens! But why, lord? There's room for\nboth. It serves no purpose...\nAurens! Look!      Aurens!\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's all right, Ferraj. It's all right.\n\nFERRAJ\nHey!\n\nMOTORCYCLIST\nWho are you? Who are you?\n\nCairo\n\nFERRAJ\nDoud!\n\nSOLDIER\nWe're here, sir.  You taking him in\nthere, sir?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nSOLDIER\nHere! Here! You! And where the hell do\nyou think you're going to, Mustafa?\n\nLAWRENCE\nEh, we're thirsty.\n\nSOLDIER\nMr Lawrence, is it?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nSOLDIER\nAre you going to the officer's bar, sir?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nSOLDIER\nYou can't take him in there, sir.\n\nOFFICER\nWhat do you think you look like?\n\nBAR MAN\nNo, no, you mustn't! Not another! Go\neffendi! Go! Get out! You must get out!\nGet out!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe want two large glasses of lemonade!\n\nBAR MAN\nThis is a bar for British Officers.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's alright; we're not particular\n\nFREDDY\nLawrence! Are you off your head?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Oddly enough, I'm not.\n\nOFFICER\nNow, look here, Lawrence, just clear out\nof here, will you?\n\nCROWD\nGo on, Lawrence, clear off! Get that boy\nout of here!\n\nOFFICER\nPogo! We'll have this one out, anyway.\n\nCROWD\nGet out! Get that wog out of here! Yes,\nclear off! Go on, get the little wog out!\n\nBRIGHTON\nWhat's going on?\n\nOFFICER\nIt's Lawrence, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nLemonade with ice.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, explain yourself.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe've taken Aqaba.\n\nBRIGHTON\nTaken Aqaba? Who has?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe have. Our side in this war have. The\nwogs have. We have. He likes your\nlemonade.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou mean the Turks have gone?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, they're still there, but they've no\nboots. Prisoners, sir. We took them\nprisoners; the entire garrison. No,\nthat's not true. We killed some; too many\nreally. I'll manage it better next time.\nThere's been a lot of killing, one way or\nanother. Cross my heart and hope to die,\nit's all perfectly true.\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt isn't possible.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, it is. I did it.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou'd better talk to Allenby.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGeneral Allenby?\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, He's in command now Murray's gone.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, that's a step in the right\ndirection. First I want a room, with a\nbed, with sheets.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, yes, of course.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's for him.\n\nBRIGHTON\nRight! You want a bed yourself, don't\nyou?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSee Allenby first, though. Will he see\nme?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI think so.\n\nLAWRENCE\nDo that then. I'd better shave\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, you had. You'd better get into some\ntrousers too.\n\n\nALLENBY\nUndisciplined...unpunctual...untidy...sev\neral languages...knowledge of\nmusic...literature...knowledge\nof...knowledge of...you're an interesting\nman, there's no doubt about it. Who told\nyou to take Aqaba?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNobody.\n\nALLENBY\nSir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSir.\n\nALLENBY\nThen, why did you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAqaba's important.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy is it important?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's the Turkish route to the Canal.\n\nALLENBY\nNot any more. They're coming through\nBethsheda.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know, but we've gone forward to Gaza.\n\nALLENBY\nSo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSo that left Aqaba behind your right.\n\nALLENBY\nTrue.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd it will be further behind your right\nwhen you go for Jerusalem.\n\nALLENBY\nAm I going for Jerusalem?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALLENBY\nVery well. Aqaba behind my right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt threatened El Herish and Gaza.\n\nALLENBY\nAnything else?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. Aqaba's linked with Medina.\n\nALLENBY\nDo you think we should shift them out of\nMedina now?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. I think you should leave them there.\n\nALLENBY\nYou acted without orders, you know?\n\nLAWRENCE\nShouldn't officers use their initiative\nat all times?\n\nALLENBY\nNot really. It's awfully dangerous,\nLawrence.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. I know.\n\nALLENBY\nAlready?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALLENBY\nI'm promoting you major.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't think that's a very good idea.\n\nALLENBY\nI didn't ask you; I want you to go\nback...and carry on the good work.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, thank you, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy not?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, I...eh, let me see...I killed two\npeople. I mean two Arabs; one was a boy.\nthat was... yesterday! I led him into\nquicksand. The other was a man; that was\nbefore Aqaba, anyway. I had to execute\nhim with my pistol. There was something\nabout it I didn't like.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, naturally...\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, something else...\n\nALLENBY\nI see, well, that's all right. We'll give\nyou a warning.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Something else.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI enjoyed it.\n\nALLENBY\nRubbish! Rubbish! You know that you're\ntired. What do you mean by coming here\ndressed like that? Amateur theatricals?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, yes. Entirely.\n\nALLENBY\nLet me see that hat-thing, or whatever it\nis. Fascinating gear they wear. How do\nyou think I would look in this hat,\nHarry?\n\nBRIGHTON\nDamn ridiculous, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nHere, you keep it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat I'm trying to say is I don't think\nI'm fit for it.\n\nALLENBY\nReally!? What do you think, Dryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nBefore he did it, sir, I'd have said it\ncouldn't be done.\n\nALLENBY\nBrighton?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know what he thinks.\n\nBRIGHTON\nI think you should recommend a\ndecoration, sir. I don't think it matters\nwhat his motives were; 'twas a brilliant\nbit of soldiering.\n\nALLENBY\nMr Perkins!\n\nPERKINS\nSah!\n\nALLENBY\nLet's have a drink, gentlemen.\n\nPERKINS\nSah!\n\nALLENBY\nYou've heard about this, Mr Perkins.\n\nPERKINS\nYes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat do you think about it?\n\nPERKINS\nBloody marvellous, sir. Well done, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nThank you, Mr Perkins.\n\nPERKINS\nSah!\n\nALLENBY\nCome on, then.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou're a clever man, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nNo, but I know a good thing when I see\none. That's fair, surely.  Look here,\nlad. If I'm going to break through to\nJerusalem, I must concentrate not\ndissipate...\n\nLAWRENCE\nGuns.\n\nALLENBY\nDo you know of better?...\n\nALLENBY\nI fight like Clausewitz, you fight like Saxe.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe shall do very well, indeed, sir.\n\n\nALLENBY\nEasy, gentlemen, please. Will you give us\nsomething to drink? Waiter    Of course,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nI'm here at the invitation of Major\nLawrence. Tracy. Shall we go outside?\nSo, you'll hold down the Turkish desert\narmy.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALLENBY\nWith a thousand Arabs?\n\nLAWRENCE\nA thousand Arabs means a thousand knives,\ndelivered anywhere, day or night...means\na thousand camels; that means a thousand\npacks of high explosive and a thousand\ncrack rifles. We can cross Arabia while\nJohnny Turk is still turning round. I'll\nsmash his railways, and while he's\nmending them I'll smash them somewhere\nelse. In thirteen weeks I can have Arabia\nin chaos.\n\nALLENBY\nYou are going back then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, of course I'm going back.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, if we can see it, so can the Turk.\nIf he finds he's using four divisions to\nfend off a handful of bandits, he'll\nwithdraw.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe daren't withdraw. Arabia's part of his\nempire: if he gets out now, he knows\nhe'll never get back again.\n\nBRIGHTON\nI wonder who will.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo one will. Arabia's for the Arabs now.\nThat's what I've told them, anyway.\nThat's what they think: that's why\nthey're fighting.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, surely.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey've only one suspicion, if we'll let\nthem drive the Turks out and then move in\nourselves. I've told them that that's\nfalse: that we've no ambitions in Arabia,\nhave we?\n\nALLENBY\nI'm not a politician, thank God. have we\nany ambition in Arabia, Dryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nDifficult question, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI want to know, sir, if I can tell them\nin your name that we have no ambitions in\nArabia.\n\nALLENBY\nCertainly.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTwo thousand small arms is not enough: I\nneed five.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nMoney. It'll have to be sovereigns: they\ndon't like paper.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nInstructors for the Lewis guns.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nMore money.\n\nALLENBY\nHow much more?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTwenty-five thousand now: a lot more\nlater.\n\nALLENBY\nDryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nIt can be done, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nA couple of armoured cars.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nField artillery.\n\nALLENBY\nRight. I'm going to give you every\nblessed thing I can, Major Lawrence,\nbecause I know you'll use it.\nCongratulations and thank you. Thank you\nfor your hospitality, gentlemen.\n\nCROWD\nCongratulations.\n\nDRYDEN\nAre you really going to give them\nartillery, sir?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI was wondering that, sir. It might be\ndeuced difficult to get it back again.\n\nDRYDEN\nGive them artillery and you've made them\nindependent.\n\nALLENBY\nThen, I can't give them artillery, can I?\n\nDRYDEN\nFor you to say, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nNo, it's not. I've got orders to obey,\nthank God. Not like that poor devil. He's\nriding the whirlwind.\n\nDRYDEN\nLet's hope we're not.\n\n\nBENTLEY\nExcuse me, friend. Who do these bags\nbelong to?\n\nSILIAM\nTo Prince Feisal.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou're not Prince Feisal, by any chance.\n\nSILIAM\nNo.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou know him, though.\n\nSILIAM\nHe is my master. I am his servant.\n\nBENTLEY\nEm. Can you read?  The Chicago Courier is\nmy own particular paper, but my work is\nsyndicated throughout America.\n\nFEISAL\nI understood so from your letter, Mr\nBentley.   Now?\n\nBENTLEY\nWhere can I find Major Lawrence?\n\nFEISAL\nIs that what you've come for?\n\nBENTLEY\nNot all together, sir, no.\n\nFEISAL\nWell, Mr Bentley, you will find Major\nLawrence with my army.\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, that's what I meant, sir. Where can\nI find your army?\n\nFEISAL\nI don't know. Last week they were near El\nHira.\n\nBENTLEY\nGira!\n\nFEISAL\nOh, yes. I fear you have a long journey.\nCan you ride a camel?\n\nBENTLEY\nI've never tried.\n\nFEISAL\nTake a mule. Avoid Malal. The Turks are\nthere.\n\nBENTLEY\nIn Malal, now? They move fast.\n\nFEISAL\nThey do, but not so fast as we do, you\nwill find.\n\nFEISAL\nMyself? I am going to Cairo, as you know.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes.\n\nFEISAL\nThere is work for me there of a different\nkind.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes. I understand you've been given no\nartillery.\n\nFEISAL\nThat is so.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou're handicapped.\n\nFEISAL\nIt restricts us to small things.\n\nBENTLEY\nIt's intended to.\n\nFEISAL\nDo you know General Allenby?\n\nBENTLEY\nWatch out for Allenby. He's a 'slim\ncustomer'.\n\nFEISAL\nExcuse me?\n\nBENTLEY\nA clever man.\n\nFEISAL\n'Slim customer'. Very good. I will\ncertainly watch out for him. You're being\nvery sympathetic, Mr Bentley.\n\nBENTLEY\nYour Highness, we Americans were once a\ncolonial people and we naturally feel\nsympathetic to any people, anywhere, who\nare struggling for their freedom.\n\nFEISAL\nVery gratifying.\n\nBENTLEY\nAlso, my interests are the same as yours.\nYou want your story told: I badly want a\nstory to tell.\n\nFEISAL\nAh, now you are 'talking turkey', are you\nnot?\n\nBENTLEY\nHa! Ha!\n\nFEISAL\nWell, Mr Bentley, I will give you a guide\nand a letter, and before I leave\nhere...Ah, which must be presently, I\nwill have some facts and figures put on\npaper for you. You know, of course, that\nwe are destroying the Turkish railways?\n\nBENTLEY\nI do, sir. Major Lawrence is in charge of\nall this, is he?\n\nFEISAL\nMy army is made up of tribes. The tribes\nare led by the tribal leaders.\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, your people do think very highly of\nMajor Lawrence, though.\n\nFEISAL\nOh, yes. And rightly. In this country, Mr\nBentley, the man who gives victory in\nbattle is prized beyond every other man.\nOne figure I can give you from my head\nbecause it never leaves my head. Since\nstarting this campaign four months ago,\nwe have lost thirty-seven wounded, one\nhundred and fifty-six dead. You remark\nthe disproportion between our dead and\nwounded.\n\nBENTLEY\nYeah. Four times as many.\n\nFEISAL\nThat's because those too badly wounded to\nbring away we ourselves kill. We leave no\nwounded for the Turks.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou mean...\n\nFEISAL\nI mean we leave no wounded for the Turks.\nIn their eyes we are not soldiers, but\nrebels, and rebels wounded or whole are\nnot protected by the Geneva Code and are\ntreated harshly.\n\nBENTLEY\nHow harshly?\n\nFEISAL\nMore harshly than I hope you can imagine.\n\nBENTLEY\nI see.\n\nFEISAL\nOur own prisoners, Mr Bentley, are taken\ncare of until the British can relieve us\nof them according to the Code. I should\nlike you to notice that.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes, sir. Is that the influence of Major\nLawrence?\n\nFEISAL\nWhy should you suppose so?\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, it's just I heard in Cairo that\nMajor Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.\n\nFEISAL\nThat is exactly so. with Major Lawrence,\nmercy is a passion: with me it is merely\ngood manners. You may judge which motive\nis the more reliable. And now, perhaps...\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, sure. Sure. Thank you, sir. Do you\nthink you'd be able to manage the letter?\n\nFEISAL\nI'll do everything I have said, Mr\nBentley, if you will tell me truly the\nnature of your interest in my people and\nMajor Lawrence.\n\nBENTLEY\nIt's very simple, sir. I'm looking for a\nhero.\n\nFEISAL\nIndeed? You do not seem a romantic man.\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, no. But certain influential men back\nhome believe that the time has come for\nAmerica to lend her weight to the\npatriotic struggle against Germany...and\nTurkey. Now, I've been sent to find\nmaterial which will show our people that\nhis war is...\n\nFEISAL\nEnjoyable?\n\nBENTLEY\nHardly that, sir. But to show it in its\nmore adventurous aspects.\n\nFEISAL\nYou are looking for a figure who will\ndraw your country towards war.\n\nBENTLEY\nAlright. Yes.\n\nFEISAL\nAurens is your man.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nStop! Stop it! Stop it! Come on, men!\n\nAUDAR\nAurens!\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, good God!\n\nBENTLEY\nJimeny! Never seen a man killed with a\nsword before.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy don't you take a picture?\n\nBENTLEY\nWish I had.\n\nAUDAR\nHow is it with thee, Aurens? No! Am I in\nthis?\n\nLAWRENCE\nDid you take his picture?\n\nBENTLEY\nYeah.\n\nAUDAR\nYou are using up your nine lives very\nquickly.\n\nBENTLEY\nCharming company you keep.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAuda? he's a bit old fashioned. He thinks\nthese things will steal his virtue. He\nthinks you're a kind of thief.\n\nBENTLEY\nIs it alright if I take your picture?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAll right.\n\nBENTLEY\nOK. Just walk.\n\nCROWD\nAurens! Aurens!\n\nBENTLEY\nMajor Lawrence? Yes, sir, that's my baby.\n\n\nBRIGHTON\nThis looting has got to stop.\n\nALI\nIt is customary.\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt's theft, and theft makes thieves.\n\nALI\nI would not say that to Auda. It is their\npayment, Colonel.\n\nBRIGHTON\nPayment!\n\nALI\nTruly, are not British soldiers paid?\n\nBRIGHTON\nThey don't go home when they're paid.\n\nALI\nThey are not free to.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, there's another lot you've seen the\nlast of.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey'll come back.\n\nBRIGHTON\nHe says they'll come back. Will they?\n\nALI\nNot this year, Aurens.\n\nBRIGHTON\nLook, Lawrence. How many men do you think\nyou'll have left? Two hundred?\n\nLAWRENCE\nLess.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, then.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI said they'll come back.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou badly hurt?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot hurt at all. Didn't you know? They\ncan only kill me with a golden bullet.\n\n\nALI\nIt is for children. I have set myself to\nlearn again.\n\nBENTLEY\nWhat are you learning from this?\n\nALI\nPolitics.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou gonna be a democracy in this country?\nYou gonna have a parliament?\n\nALI\nI will tell you that when I have a\ncountry.\n\nBENTLEY\nHa! Ha!...\n\nALI\nDid I answer well?\n\nBENTLEY\nYou answered without saying anything.\nThat's politics. You learn quickly.\n\nALI\nI have a good teacher.\n\nBENTLEY\nYeah. Yeah.\nHow's your hurt?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFine.\n\nBENTLEY\nBefore I return to the flesh-pots, which\nI shall be very glad to do, may I put two\nquestions to you? Straight?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'd be interested to hear you put a\nquestion straight, Mr Bentley.\n\nBENTLEY\nOne: What, in your opinion, do these\npeople hope to gain from this war?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey hope to gain their freedom. Freedom.\n\nBENTLEY\nThey hope to gain their freedom. There's\none born every minute.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey're going to get it, Mr Bentley. I'm\ngoing to give it to them. The second\nquestion?\n\nBENTLEY\nOh. Well, I was going to ask...eh; what\nis it, Major Lawrence, that attracts you\npersonally to the desert?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's clean.\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, now. That's a very illuminating\nanswer. May I take one farewell picture?\n\nAUDAR\nI gave Math Budad two lamps for it. One\nclock for two lamps.\n\nBRIGHTON\nA fair bargain.\n\nAUDAR\nI robbed him. I must find something\nhonourable.\n\nBRIGHTON\nHonourable?\n\nAUDAR\nYes, the year is running out, Brighton. I\nmust find something honourable.\n\n\nAUDAR\nNow, you may blow up my train.\n\nBRIGHTON\nAnd what will you do now?\n\nAUDAR\nOh, now I go home. They will carry my\ntoys. They will carry my toys, too, do\nyou see?\n\nBRIGHTON\nMajor Lawrence will campaign this winter,\nbut you've got what you wanted so you're\ngoing home. Is that it?\n\nAUDAR\nOf course! When Aurens has got what he\nwants, he will go home. When you have got\nwhat you want, you will go home.\n\nBRIGHTON\nOh, no, I shan't, Auda.\n\nAUDAR\nThen you are a fool.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMaybe. I am not a deserter.\n\nAUDAR\nGive thanks to God, Brighton, that when\nhe made you a fool, he gave you a fool's\nface.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou are an impudent rascal!\n\nAUDAR\nI must go, Aurens, before I soil myself\nwith a fool's blood.\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt's like talking to a brick wall. So,\nwhat'll you do now? What can you do?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll go north. That's what Allenby wants,\nisn't it?\n\nBRIGHTON\nAllenby wanted the Arab army behind\nDar'a.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen that's where I'll take it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTell Allenby to hurry up; that we'll be\nin Dar'a before he's in Jerusalem, won't\nwe?\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nTrain! Ferraj.\n\nFERRAJ\nYa! Aurens.\nBedouin   Aii!\n\nLAWRENCE\nHide yourself, my friend.     Detonator.\nAlright, fetch another.\n\nFERRAJ\nPardon, Aurens, I put it in...\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere's plenty of time; fetch another!\nFerraj? Ferraj!\n\nALI\nWhat happened?\n\nLAWRENCE\nDetonator. A detonator.\n\nBEDOUIN\nHe cannot ride, Aurens. Look.\n\nALI\nIf they take him alive, you know what\nthey will do to him.\n\nFERRAJ\nDaud will be angry with you.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSalute him for me.\n\n\nALI\nWhat will you do now?\n\nLAWRENCE\nGo north.\n\nALI\nWith twenty?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat would you recommend me to do, Ali?\nWhat would you recommend?\n\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, he hasn't one-tenth so many men,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nHe's lied, in fact.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes and no. He doesn't claim to have done\nanything he hasn't done.\n\nALLENBY\nThen there is an Arab north army?\n\nBRIGHTON\nNo, sir, he has lied about that.\n\nALLENBY\nAny idea why?\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt's his army, I suppose.\n\nALLENBY\nIt's Prince Feisal's army. Do you think\nhe's gone native, Harry?\n\nBRIGHTON\nNo. He would if he could, I think. Not my\nline of country this, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, it doesn't matter; I'm just curious.\nWhat matters is I believed it. The Turks\nbelieve it. They're offering twenty\nthousand pounds for him.\n\nBRIGHTON\nGood Heavens!\n\nALLENBY\nNo. Shouldn't say he'd long to live,\nwould you?\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, whatever else, sir, he's a brave\nman.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, surely, surely. If he's still going\nnorth with fifty men, he doesn't lack\n'guts'. I wonder if they'd offer that\nmuch for me. What about next year? Will\nthey still come back?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI wouldn't be surprised. They think he's\na kind of prophet.\n\nALLENBY\nThey do or he does?\n\n\nALI\nNow, may I speak?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALI\nAurens. One more failure, and you will\nfind yourself alone. I do not include\nmyself.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI do not include the others.\n\nALI\nSo, say they love you: the more reason to\nbe thrifty with them. give them something\nto do that can be done. But you? No, no,\nthey must move mountains for you: they\nmust walk on water.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's right. That's right! Who are you\nto know what can be done. If we'd done\nwhat you thought could be done, we'd be\nback in Yenbo now, and nowhere. Whatever\nI ask them to do, can be done, that's\nall. They know that if you don't. Do you\nthink I'm just anybody, Ali? Do you?\nMy friends. Who will walk on water with\nme? Who will come with me into Dar'a?\n\nBEDOUIN\nDar'a is garrisoned. Will you take twenty\nagainst two thousand?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll go by myself if I have to.\n\nBEDOUIN\nWhy?\n\nLAWRENCE\nBecause I told the English generals the\nArab revolt will be in Dar'a when they\nwould be in Jerusalem.\n\nBEDOUIN\nOr perhaps you are here for the English\ngenerals.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWho says this?\n\nALI\nRumour.\n\nBEDOUIN\nThat is not an argument.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo argument. This afternoon, I will take\nthe Arab revolt into Dar'a while the\nArabs argue.\n\nBEDOUIN\nAurens! Can you pass for an Arab in an\nArab town?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, if one of you would lend me some\ndirty clothes.\n\nDar'a\n\nALI\nThis is madness! What are you looking\nfor?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSome way to announce myself.\n\nALI\nBe patient with him, God.\n\nALI\nDo you not see how they look at you?\nCome!\n\nLAWRENCE\nPlease, Ali. I am invisible.\n\nTURK\nHalt!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWalk on.\n\nTURK\nHalt!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWalk on.\n\nTURK\nYou! And You!\n\nBEY\nYou.      You have blue eyes? I say you\nhave blue eyes.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, efendi.\n\nBEY\nAre you Sicasian?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, efendi.\n\nBEY\nHow old are you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTwenty-seven, efendi. I think.\n\nBEY\nYou look older. You have had a lot of\nexperience. It's an interesting face. I'm\nsurrounded by cattle. He wouldn't know an\ninteresting face from a sow's belly. I\nhave been in Dar'a now for three and a\nhalf years. If they'd posted me to the\ndark side of the moon, I could not be\nmore isolated. You haven't the least idea\nof what I'm talking about, have you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, efendi.\n\nBEY\nHave you? No. That would be too lucky.\nWhere did you get that?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, eh, it's old, efendi.\n\nBEY\nNo, no. This is recent. You are a\ndeserter.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, efendi.\n\nBEY\nYes, you're a deserter, but from which\narmy? Not that it matters at all. A man\ncannot be always in uniform. Your skin is\nvery fair.      Beat him.\n\n\nALI\nSleep. Sleep!       Eat. Eat! You have a\nbody like other men. Good. Then sleep.\n\n\nALI\nBetter?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMuch better. You were right.\n\nALI\nRest, rest. Can you not learn?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, I've learned alright. I'm going, Ali.\n\nALI\nWhy?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy? Heavens!\n\nALI\nWhy?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've come to the end of myself, I\nsuppose.\n\nALI\nAnd the end of the Arab revolt?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm not the Arab revolt, Ali. I'm not\neven Arab.\n\nALI\nA man can be whatever he wants, you said.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry. I thought it was, too.\n\nALI\nYou proved it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nLook, Ali. Look! That's me. What colour\nis it? That's me! And there's nothing I\ncan do about it.\n\nALI\nA man can do whatever he wants, you said.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe can, but he can't want what he wants.\nThis is the stuff that decides what he\nwants. You may as well know, I would have\ntold them anything; I would have told\nthem who I am; I would have told them\nwhere you were; I tried to.\n\nALI\nSo would any man.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, any man is what I am and I'm going\nback to Allenby to ask him for a job that\nany man can do.\n\nALI\nAllenby's in Jerusalem.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll make easy stages.\n\nALI\nYou!\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, yes. Easy stages. Look, Ali, I think\nI see a way of being just ordinarily\nhappy. Can I take this?\n\nALI\nIt is not clean.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, but it's warm.\n\nALI\nAnd these? Having led them here! Have you\nno care for them?\n\nALI\nYou'll lead them. They're yours. Trust\nyour own people and let me go back to\nmine.\n\n\nSOLDIER\nI say, don't forget those form fives.\n\nSOLDIER\nAll right!\n\nLAWRENCE\nHey? Mind if I join you?\n\nOFFICER\nOh. Honoured, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood to be back.\n\nOFFICER\nWe heard you were, sir. What's doing out\nthere?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhere? Oh, Arabia.\n\nOFFICER\nEh, yes, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNothing much. Wrong time of year. What's\ndoing here?\n\nOFFICER\nWe're settling in alright, sir.     We've\nbuilt a squash court.\n\nLAWRENCE\nJolly good. Well, I have to go up there.\nIt's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.\n\nOFFICER\nBloody wogs!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, probably. Jolly good about the\nsquash court.\n\nOFFICER\nLays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMorning.\n\nMP\nOh, morning, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood to be back.\n\nMP\nI'll believe you, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, really, it is.       Hello.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMorning. You're to go right in.\n\nFEISAL\nAurens, or is it Major Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSir.\n\nFEISAL\nAh. Ai. Well, General, I will leave you.\nMajor Lawrence, doubtless, has reports to\nmake about my people and their weakness,\nand the need to keep them weak in the\nBritish interest...and the French\ninterest too, of course. We must not\nforget the French now...\n\nALLENBY\nI've told you, sir, no such treaty\nexists.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, General, you have lied most bravely,\nbut not convincingly. I know this treaty\ndoes exist.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTreaty, sir?\n\nFEISAL\nHe does it better than you, General, but\nthen, of course, he is almost an Arab.\n\nDRYDEN\nYou really don't know?\n\nALLENBY\nThen what the devil's this?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's my request for release from Arabia,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nFor what reason? Are you sure you haven't\nheard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. I can guess\n\nALLENBY\nDon't guess! Tell him!\n\nDRYDEN\nWell, now. Mr Sykes is and English civil\nservant. Monsieur Picot is a French civil\nservant. Mr Sykes and Monsieur Picot met\nand they agreed that after the war,\nFrance and England would share the\nTurkish Empire, including Arabia. They\nsigned an agreement, not a treaty, sir.\nAn agreement to that effect.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere may be honour among thieves, but\nthere's none in politicians.\n\nDRYDEN\nAnd let's no have displays of\nindignation. You may not have known, but\nyou certainly had suspicions. If we've\ntold lies, you've told half-lies and a\nman who tells lies, like me, merely hides\nthe truth, but a man who tells half-lies\nhas forgotten where he put it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe truth is I'm an ordinary man. You\nmight have told me that, Dryden, and I\nwant an ordinary job, sir. That's my\nreason for resigning. It's personal.\n\nALLENBY\nPersonal?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nPersonal? You're a serving officer in the\nfield, and as it happens, a damned\nimportant one. Personal? Are you mad?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, and if you don't mind, I'd rather not\ngo mad. That's my reason, too.\n\nALLENBY\nLook, Lawrence. I'm making my big push on\nDamascus the sixteenth of next month and\nyou are part of it. Can you understand\nthat? You're an important part of the big\npush.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't want to be part of your big push!\n\nALLENBY\nWhat about your Arab friends? What about\nthem?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have no Arab friends! I don't want Arab\nfriends!\n\nALLENBY\nWhat in hell do you want, Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've told you. I just want my ration of\ncommon humanity.\n\nDRYDEN\nLawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes?\n\nDRYDEN\nNothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, that's quite all right, thank you, Mr\nDryden.\n\nDRYDEN\nThank you, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nLook. Why don't we...there's blood on\nyour back. Do you want a doctor?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nALLENBY\nTell me what happened.\n\n\nBENTLEY\nSo, what goes on in there?\n\nDRYDEN\nNothing.\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, come on!\n\nDRYDEN\nNo, really. Nothing at all.\n\nBENTLEY\nIs the man in trouble?\n\nDRYDEN\nI expect so. We all have troubles. Life's\na vale of troubles.\n\nBENTLEY\nJust let me know if the man's in trouble;\nI've got an interest in that man; I've\ngot a claim!\n\nDRYDEN\nWhat claim?\n\nBENTLEY\nYou've read my stuff. I've made that boy\na hero. When the war's over, that boy can\nbe anything he wants.\n\nDRYDEN\nYes. Well, at the moment he wants to be\nsomebody else. Will you kindly allow me\nto pass?\n\nBENTLEY\nWalk away, Dryden. Walk away. Always\nwalking away, aren't you?\n\nDRYDEN\nWell, I'll tell you. It's a little clash\nof temperament that's going on in there,\ninevitably. One of them's half-mad, and\nthe other, wholly unscrupulous.\n\n\nALLENBY\nI believe your name will be a household\nword when you'll have to go to the War\nMuseum to find who Allenby was. You're\nthe most extraordinary man I've ever met.\n\nLAWRENCE\nLeave me alone!\n\nALLENBY\nWhat?\n\nLAWRENCE\nLeave me alone!\n\nALLENBY\nWell, that's a feeble thing to say.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know I'm not ordinary.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's not what I'm saying.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAll right! I'm extraordinary. What of it?\n\nALLENBY\nNot many people have a destiny, Lawrence.\nIt's a terrible thing for a man to funk\nit if he has.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAre you speaking from experience?\n\nALLENBY\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou're guessing, then. Suppose you're\nwrong.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy suppose that? We both know I'm right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes...\n\nALLENBY\n...After all...\n\nLAWRENCE\nI said, 'Yes'. The sixteenth?\n\nALLENBY\nCan you do it? I'll give you a lot of\nmoney.\n\nLAWRENCE\nArtillery?\n\nALLENBY\nI can't.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey won't be coming for money; not the\nbest of them. They's be coming for\nDamascus, which I'm going to give them.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's all I want.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAll you want is someone holding down the\nTurkish right, but I'm going to give them\nDamascus. We'll get there before you do,\nand when we've got it, we'll keep it. You\ncan tell the politicians to burn their\nbit of paper, now.\n\nALLENBY\nFair enough.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFair. What's 'fair' got to do with it?\nIt's going to happen. I shall want quite\na lot of money.\n\nALLENBY\nAll there is.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot that much. The best of them won't\ncome for money; they'll come for me.\n\n\nAUDA\nNo pictures! You take no pictures!\n\nBENTLEY\nIt's not for you, sheika, it's for Major\nLawrence. He doesn't mind having his\npicture taken. He doesn't mind at all.\n\nAUDA\nWell, there's only one Aurens.\n\nBENTLEY\nHave you met Major Lawrence since he's\ncome back, sherif?\n\nALI\nYes.\n\nBENTLEY\nChanged, hasn't he?\n\nALI\nNo!\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, I'd say he had. Different man, I'd\nsay. What did that Turkish general do to\nhim  in Dar'a?\n\nALI\nHe was the same man after Dar'a. The same\nman. Humbled. What did the English\ngeneral do to him in Jerusalem?\n\nBENTLEY\nSearch me? Ask Aurens.\n\nALI\nI did.\n\nBENTLEY\nWhat did he say?\n\nALI\nHe laughed. He told me to gather the\nHarif here. He offered me money.\n\nBENTLEY\nDid you take it?\n\nALI\nNo. But many did.     What is this?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThis is my bodyguard.\n\nALI\nThere's not a man there without a price\non his head.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere's a price on my head, too.\n\nALI\nBut these are murderers. You know the\nsheiks will hang these men.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThese men are mine.\n\nALI\nAurens. These things know nothing of the\nArab revolt. You! You son of a leper.\n\nGUARD\nSherif?\n\nALI\nWhere do we ride?\n\nGUARD\nDamascus, sherif.\n\nALI\nAye, but for what?\n\nGUARD\nSherif? For Aurens.\n\nALI\nYou have bought these things!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI bought half the men here, Ali.\n\nALI\nThat is different. These are not ordinary\nmen!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't want ordinary men!     Damascus!!\n\nAUDAR\nAurens!\n\n\nALLENBY\nVery well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone\nthrough Masseriel and Dar'a. Very good,\nby the way. very good indeed. Now your\nturn.\n\nCHARLEY\nWell, sir, if the enemy's retreating in\nany kind of order, which we'd better\nassume,...\n\nALLENBY\nCertainly.\n\nCHARLEY\n...he can't be further than this Malad\nplace. In which case I can have him\nwithin range by, eh,  o-nine hundred\nhours tomorrow.\n\nALLENBY\nSplendid! Philip.\n\nPHILIP\nWell, these are the last infantry\nsupports going up now, sir, but Malad\ncould have the Fusiliers there by\nWednesday, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nThat'll do for now. The guns are what\nmatter. Any questions?\n\nOFFICER\nThis Arab army on the right, sir. What\ndoes it consist of?\n\nBRIGHTON\nIrregular cavalry, sir. About two\nthousand.\n\nOFFICER\nWhere are they now?\n\nBENTLEY\n(We) Can only know that by being with\nthem, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nThen get with them, Harry. I want to\nknow.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nPound them, Charley! Pound them!\n\n\nALI\nGod help the men who lie under that!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey're Turks.\n\nALI\nGod help them!\n\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, he's got the bit between his teeth\nalright.\n\nALLENBY\nCocky?\n\nBRIGHTON\nMore than cocky, sir. He's got the bit\nbetween his teeth. All right. I tell you,\nsir, I think he'll get to Damascus before\nwe do unless...\n\nALLENBY\nUnless?\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, there's a Turkish column in front\nof him. Out of Masriel.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat do the Turks have in Masriel? I\nwonder where they are now.\n\n\n\nGUARD\nNo prisoners.\n\nALI\nDamascus, Aurens.     Aurens. Not this.\nGo round. Damascus, Aurens! Damascus!\n\nGUARD\nNo prisoners.\n\nALI\nAurens?\n\nAUDAR\nThis was Talal's village.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo prisoners! No prisoners!\n\nALI\nGod. God! God!!     Aurens! Enough!\nEnough! Make them stop!     Aurens!\n\nBENTLEY\nMajor! Major Lawrence! Jesus wept! Jesus\nwept!\n\nALI\nDoes it surprise you, Mr Bentley? Surely,\nyou know the Arabs are a barbarous\npeople. Barbarous and cruel. Who but\nthey! Who but they!\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, you rotten man. Here, let me take\nyour rotten bloody picture for the rotten\nbloody newspapers.\n\n\nBEDOUIN\nThese were cut last night, Aurens, in\nDamascus. Damascus!\n\nLAWRENCE\nTake them to Sherif Ali. Tell him. Remind\nhim. Is Allenby in Damascus?\n\nBEDOUIN\nNear.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTell Sherif Ali that.\n\nBEDOUIN\nThey are not ripe, ha, ha.\n\n\nSOLDIER\nGeneral salute! Present arms! Hold Arms!\n\nBRIGHTON\nLawrence is behind it, sir. Lawrence. The\nwhole town has passed onto the Arab flag.\n\nALLENBY\nWhen?\n\nBRIGHTON\nA day and a night, sir. They've been here\na day and a night. They've occupied the\ntown, sir. They've done it. He's set up\nhis own headquarters in the town hall.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat else besides the town hall?\n\nBRIGHTON\nThe telephone exchange, post office,\npower house, hospital, fire station,\neverything, sir. They call themselves the\nArab National Council and they're in the\ntown hall.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, they're your pigeon, Harry. What do\nyou think we should do about it?\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, get them out of it, sir, quick\ntime.\n\nALLENBY\nHow about that, Dryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nNot unless you want a full-scale rising\non your hands, sir.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, what, then?\n\nDRYDEN\nWhen will Prince Feisal be in Damascus?\n\nALLENBY\nBy special train in two days' time.\n\nDRYDEN\nTwo days.\n\nALLENBY\nTwo days is what you asked me for. I\ncan't keep him out any longer. Isn't it\nenough?\n\nDRYDEN\nYes, ample. I should think.\n\nBRIGHTON\nLook, sir, we can't just do nothing.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy not? It's usually best.\n\nALLENBY\nGet us something to drink, Tracy.\nTracy     Yes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nAnd Tracy, all troops to remain quartered\nuntil further notice.\n\nTRACY\nYes, sir. Does that apply to technical\nunits, sir?\n\nALLENBY\nTechnical Units particularly.\n\nTRACY\nYes, sir.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMedicals, too, sir?\n\nALLENBY\nI'm afraid so, Harry. Medicals too.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe, here, are neither Harif, nor Howetat,\nnor any other tribe, but Arabs at the\nArab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.\n\nAUDA\nHe insulted me.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali said that the telephones were\nin the care of the Howetat, and that the\ntelephones had ceased to work, and this\nis true, Auda.\n\nAUDA\nThey will not work because they are given\nno electricity. The electricity is in the\ncare of the Harif.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIf you answer there'll be bloodshed.\n\nALI\nYou speak to me of bloodshed? I ask\npardon of Auda Bute.\n\nAUDA\nHumbly? Humbly! Harif!\n\nALI\nYes! Humbly!\n\nAUDA\nThis is a new trick.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy is there no electricity?\n\nALI\nI have been to that electrical house,\nAurens. There are three large machines.\n\nVOICE FROM THE BALCONY\nHe means 'generators'!\n\nALI\nSo, one of them is burned. They are of an\nincredible size, but helpless.\n\nAUDA\nIt is so of all machines. Let them burn!\nWhat need of telephones?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe need is absolute.\n\nALI\nThen, we need the English engineers.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo! Take English engineers and you take\nEnglish government. Take...\n\nSOLIDER\nFire has broken out.\n\nALI\nWhere?\n\nSOLIDER\nIn the Gensebe district.\n\nALI\nIt is not a district that matters.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt will spread.\n\nALI\nThen, in God's name, use the fire\nbrigade!\n\nSOLIDER\nWe have tried, Aurens, but there is force\nin the water.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, you must carry it.\n\nALI\nThe Urala do not carry water.\n\nAUDA\nWhat else are they good for?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe will hear petitions this afternoon.\nThis afternoon!\n\n\nALLENBY\nI'm going to take this up after the war.\n\nBRIGHTON\nSurely, we should do something, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nIt's an old man's sport.\n\nDRYDEN\nAre you an old man, sir?\n\nALLENBY\nHmm.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, all I can say is, sir, it's a heavy\nresponsibility. Sorry, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nMaybe, it's the bulb.\n\nDRYDEN\nNo, sir. It's the power. They're leaving,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's it, then. Marvellous-looking\nbeggars, aren't they?\n\n\nAUDA\nLeave this, Aurens. Come with me!\n\nLAWRENCE\nCome where?\n\nAUDA\nBack! I know your heart. What is it? Is\nit this? I tell you; this is nothing. Is\nit the blood? The desert has dried up\nmore blood than you could think of.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI pray that I may never see the desert\nagain. Hear me, God!\n\nAUDA\nYou will come. There is only the desert\nfor you.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat about you, Ali?\n\nALI\nNo. I shall stay here and learn politics.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's a very low occupation.\n\nALI\nI had no thought of it when I met you.\nYou tried very hard to give us Damascus.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's what I came for. And that would be\nsomething.\n\nALI\nYes. Much.\n\nAUDAR\nHe is your friend?\n\nALI\nTake your hand away!\n\nAUDA\nYou love him.\n\nALI\nNo, I fear him.\n\nAUDAR\nThen, why do you weep?\n\nALI\nI fear him who love him? Or must he fear\nhimself or hate himself. Take your hand\naway!  Howitat!\n\nAUDA\nOh, so you are not yet entirely\npolitician.\n\nALI\nNot yet.\n\nAUDA\nWell, these are new tricks and I am an\nold dog. And Allah be thanked. I'll tell\nthee what, though; being an Arab will be\nthornier than you suppose, Harif!\n\n\nDOCTOR\nIn all my years as a medical officer I've\nnever seen anything like it.\n\nALLENBY\nIt comes within the jurisdiction of the\nArab Council.\n\nDOCTOR\nI'm sorry, sir, under the circumstances I\nthink I must take over immediately.\n\nALLENBY\nUnder any circumstance at all, you must\nobey your orders.\n\nDOCTOR\nNo, sir, I will not.\n\nALLENBY\nControl yourself. Now, go over to the\nTown Hall and see what they say.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe did what we could in the civic\nhospitals.\n\nDOCTOR\nBut you forgot the Turkish military\nhospital.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nDOCTOR\nIt has six hundred beds. There are about\ntwo thousand Turkish wounded in it. all\nof whom are the responsibility of your\nprecious Arab Council.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat's it like?\n\n\nOFFICER\nThis is outrageous! Outrageous!\nOutrageous!! You filthy little wog!\n\n\nFEISAL\nMy friend, Aurens, if I may call him\nthat. My friend, Aurens. How many men\nwill claim the right to use that phrase?\nHow proudly! He longs for the greenness\nof his native land; he pines for the\ngothic cottages of, eh, Surrey? Is it\nnot? Already, in imagination he catches\ntrout and engages in all the activities\nof the English gentleman.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's me you're describing, sir, not\nColonel Lawrence. You're promoted\nColonel.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes? What for?\n\nFEISAL\nTake the honour, Colonel. Be a little\nkind.\n\nALLENBY\nAs a Colonel, you'll have a cabin to\nyourself on the boat home.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, thank you.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, then, God speed.\n\nFEISAL\nThere's nothing further here for a\nwarrior. We drive bargains. Old men's\nwork. Young men make wars and the virtues\nof war are the virtues of young men;\ncourage and hope for the future. Then,\nold men make the peace. And the vices of\npeace are the vices of old men; mistrust\nand caution. It must be so. What I owe\nyou is beyond evaluation. The power-\nhouse, the telephone exchange - these I\nconcede; the pumping plant I must retain.\n\nALLENBY\nIf you retain the pumping-plant, there'll\nbe no water, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nI shall be glad of any technical\nassistance.\n\nALLENBY\nIn fairness then, you must bring down\nyour flag.\n\nFEISAL\nI shall not bring down my flag, and if\nyour men attempt it, my men will resist\nit.\n\nALLENBY\nHave you any men, sir?\n\nFEISAL\nEnough for that. It's the kind of thing\nthat makes a very ugly incident. I'm sure\nyou're government does not wish to appear\nat the peace conference in the light of\nan aggressor.\n\nSOLDIER\nI say! It's Lawrence, isn't it? Well, may\nI shake you're hand, sir? Just want to be\nable to say I'd done it, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHaven't we met before?\n\nSOLDIER\nDon't think so, sir. Oh, no, sir. I\nshould have remembered that.\n\n\nFEISAL\nIt is widely known the Arab council took\npower in my name.\n\nALLENBY\nThey have no power, sir. It's illusory.\n\nFEISAL\nIllusions can be very powerful;\nparticularly when they take this form.\nThe world is delighted at the picture of\nDamascus liberated by the Arab army.\n\nALLENBY\nLed, may I remind you, sir, by a British\nserving officer.\n\nFEISAL\nAh, yes. But then Aurens is a sword with\ntwo edges. We are equally glad to be rid\nof him. Are we not?\n\nALLENBY\nI thought I was a hard man, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nYou are merely a general. I must be a\nking.\n\nBRIGHTON\nExcuse me, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nWell?\n\nDRYDEN\nWell. It seems we're to have a British\nwaterworks with an Arab flag on it. Do\nyou think it was worth it?\n\nALLENBY\nNot my business. Thank God I'm a soldier!\n\nDRYDEN\nYes, sir. So you keep saying.\n\nFEISAL\nYou, I suspect, are chief architect of\nthis compromise. What do you think?\n\nDRYDEN\nMe? Your Highness? On the whole, I wish\nI'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.\n\n\nSOLDIER\nWell, sir. Going 'ome.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHmm?\n\nSOLDIER\n'Ome, sir.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End"
