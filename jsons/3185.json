(Don't trust your feelings)\nHow will I know?\nHow will I know? (Love can be deceiving)\nHow will I know?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow will I know if he really loves me?\nI say a prayer with every heart beat\nI fall in love whenever we meet\nI'm asking you what you know about these things\nHow will I know if he's thinking of me?\nI try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)\nFalling in love is so bittersweet\nThis love is strong, why do I feel weak?\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, wake me, I'm shaking\nWish I had you near me now\nSaid there's no mistakin'\nWhat I feel is really love\nOoh, tell me\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHow will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)\nHow will I know?\nHow will I know? (Love can be deceiving)\nHow will I know?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow will I know if he really loves me?\nI say a prayer with every heart beat\nI fall in love whenever we meet\nI'm asking you what you know about these things\nHow will I know if he's thinking of me?\nI try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)\nFalling in love is so bittersweet\nThis love is strong, why do I feel weak?\n\n[Bridge]\nIf he loves me\nIf he loves me not\nIf he loves me\nIf he loves me not\nIf he loves me\nIf he loves me not\nOh, how will I know?\nHow will I know?\nHow will I know?\nHey, how will I know?\n[Chorus]\nHow will I know if he really loves me?\nI say a prayer with every heart beat\nI fall in love whenever we meet\nI'm asking you what you know about these things\nHow will I know if he's thinking of me?\nI try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)\nFalling in love is so bittersweet\nThis love is strong, why do I feel weak?\n\n[Outro]\nHow will I know? (How will I know?)\nHow will I know?\nHow will I know? (I say a prayer)\nHow will I know? Ooh\nHow will I know? (I fall in love)\nHow will I know?\nHow will I know?\nI'm asking you"
