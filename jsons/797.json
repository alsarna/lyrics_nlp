    "lyrics": "I cry myself to sleep each night\nWishing I could hold you tight\nLife seems so empty since you went away\nThe pillow where you lay your head\nNow holds my lonely tears instead\nAnd it keeps right on a-hurtin'\nSince you're gone\n\nIt keeps right on a-hurtin every minute of the day\nEvery hour you're away I feel so lonely\nAnd I can't help it, I don't think I can go on\nAnd it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone\n\nThey say a man should never cry\nBut when I see you passing by\nMy heart breaks down and cries a million tears\nYou broke my heart and set me free\nBut you forgot your memory\nAnd keeps right on a-hurtin' since your gone\n\nIt keeps right on a-hurtin every minute of the day\nEvery hour you're away I feel so lonely\nAnd I can't help it, I don't think I can go on\nAnd it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone"
