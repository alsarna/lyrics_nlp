    "lyrics": "Debonair lullabies\nIn melodies revealed\nIn deep despair on lonely nights\nHe knows just how you feel\nThe slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits\nIn miracles made real\n\nLike a bird in flight on a hot sweet night\nYou know you're right just to hold her tight\nHe soothes it right, makes it out of sight\nAnd everything's good in the world tonight\n\nWhen Smokey sings, I hear violins\nWhen Smokey sings, I forget everything\nAs she's packing her things\nAs she's spreading her wings\nThe front door might slam\nBut the back door it rings\nAnd Smokey sings, he sings\n\nElegance in eloquence\nFor sale or rent or hire\nShould I say yes and match his best\nThen I would be a liar\nSymphonies that soothe the rage\nWhen lovers' hearts catch fire\nLike a bird in flight on a hot sweet night\nYou know you're right just to hold her tight\nHe soothes it right, makes it out of sight\nAnd everything's good in the world tonight\n\nWhen Smokey sings, I hear violins\nWhen Smokey sings, I forget everything\nAs she's packing her things\nAs she's spreading her wings\nSmashing the hell\nWith the heaven she brings\nThen Smokey sings, he sings\n\n(Would it be true to say)\n\nLuther croons\nSly's the original originator\nJames screams\nMarvin was the only innovator\nBut nothing can compare\nNothing can compare\nWhen Smokey sings\n\nWhen Smokey sings, I hear violins\nWhen Smokey sings, I forget everything\nAs she's packing her things\nAs she's spreading her wings\nShe threw back the ring\nWhen Smokey sings\nSmokey sings\nSmokey sings"
