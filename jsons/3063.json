    "lyrics": "Time Will Reveal Lyrics[Verse 1/El DeBarge]\nWhat can I do ?\nTo make you feel secure\nRemove all your doubts\nSo that you know for sure that your the apple of my eye girl\nFulfillment of my dreams, time , will show the value\nOf just what you mean to me\nMore precious than silver\nMore precious than diamond rings\nOr anything that I could give you, it wouldn't mean a thing\nIf you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through\nBut is it good to know you do\n\n[Hook]\nI know just how you feel\nBut this time love's for real\nIn time it will reveal\nThat special love that's deep inside of us\nWill all reveal in time\n[Verse 2/El DeBarge]\nI tell you I love you\nBut you won't believe its true\nMore precious than silver\nMore precious than diamond rings\nOr anything that I could give you, it wouldn't mean a thing\nIf you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through\nBut is it good to know you do, aah\n\n\n[Hook until the song fades]1Embed"
