(Will I never make love, never make love?)\nPlease understand if love ends (Please, please understand, if it should ever end, oh no)\nThen I promise you, I promise you that\nThat I shall never breathe again\n(Breathe again, breathe again) (No, no, no)\nThat I shall never breathe again\n(Breathe again)\nThat I shall never breathe again\n(Breathe again, breathe again) (No, no, no)\nThat I shall never breathe\n(Breathe again)\nAgain"
