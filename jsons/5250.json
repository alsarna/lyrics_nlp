Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI spent 20 years trying to get out of this place\nI was looking for something I couldn't replace\nI was running away from the only thing I've ever known\nLike a blind dog without a bone\nI was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone\nI hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold\nI been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown\nSaving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone\nWho says you can't go home?\n\n[Chorus]\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place they call me one of their own\nJust a hometown boy, born a rolling stone\nWho says you can't go home?\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact\nThere's only one place left I want to go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright\n[Verse 2]\nI went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face\nThere isn't one of these lines that I would erase\nI lived a million miles of memories on that road\nWith every step I take I know that I'm not alone\nYou take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home\nThese are my streets, the only life I've ever known\nWho says you can't go home\n\n[Chorus]\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place they call me one of their own\nJust a hometown boy, born a rolling stone\nWho says you can't go home?\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact\nThere's only one place left I want to go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright\n\n[Verse 3]\nI been there, done that and I ain't looking back\nIt's been a long long road\nFeels like I never left, that's how the story goes\nIt doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go\nIf it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road\nTake it in, take it with you when you go\nWho says you can't go home?\n[Chorus]\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place they call me one of their own\nJust a hometown boy, born a rolling stone\nWho says you can't go home?\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact\nThere's only one place left I want to go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright\nWho says you can't go home?\nWho says you can't go home?2Embed"
