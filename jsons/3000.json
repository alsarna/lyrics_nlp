    "lyrics": "[Spoken Intro]\nDearly beloved\nWe are gathered here today\nTo get through this thing called \"life\"\nElectric word, life\nIt means forever and that's a mighty long time\nBut I'm here to tell you there's something else\nThe afterworld\nA world of never ending happiness\nYou can always see the sun, day or night\nSo when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills\nYou know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright\nInstead of asking him how much of your time is left\nAsk him how much of your mind, babe\n'Cause in this life\nThings are much harder than in the afterworld\nIn this life\nYou're on your own\nAnd if de-elevator tries to bring you down\nGo crazy (Punch a higher floor)\nWhoo\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf you don't like\nThe world you're living in\nTake a look around\nAt least you got friends\nYou see I called my old lady\nFor a friendly word\nShe picked up the phone\nDropped it on the floor\n(Ah, ah) is all I heard\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAre we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?\nOh no, lets go\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's go crazy\nLet's get nuts\nLet's look for the purple banana\nUntil they put us in the truck, let's go\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe're all excited\nBut we don't know why\nMaybe it's 'cause\nWe're all gonna die\nAnd when we do (when we do)\nWhat's it all for? (whatâ€™s it all for?)\nYou better live now\n'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?\nOh no, let's go\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's go crazy\nLet's get nuts\nLook for the purple banana\nUntil they put us in the truck, let's go\n[Ad lib/Instrumental break]\nC'mon, baby\nLet's get nuts\nYeah\n(Crazy)\nLet's go crazy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAre we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?\nOh no, let's go\nGo (Go crazy)\n\n[Bridge]\nI said let's go crazy (go crazy)\nLet's go (Let's go)\nGo (Let's go)\n\n[Verse 3]\nDr. Everything'll-Be-Alright\nWill make everything go wrong\nPills and thrills and daffodils will kill\nHang tough, children\nHe's coming\nHe's coming\nComing\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Outro]\nTake me away!"
