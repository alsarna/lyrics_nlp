(What's it all for?)\nYou better live now\n'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?\nOh no, let's go\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's go crazy\nLet's get nuts\nLook for the purple banana\nUntil they put us in the truck, let's go\n\n[Bridge]\nC'mon, baby\nLet's get nuts\nYeah\n(Crazy)\nLet's go crazy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAre we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?\nOh no, let's go\nGo (Go crazy)\n\n[Bridge]\nI said let's go crazy (Go crazy)\nLet's go (Let's go)\nGo (Let's go)\n[Verse 3]\nDr. Everything'll-Be-Alright\nWill make everything go wrong\nPills and thrills and daffodils will kill\nHang tough, children\nHe's coming\nHe's coming\nComing\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Outro]\nTake me away14Embed"
