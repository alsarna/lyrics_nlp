    "lyrics": "I love you more and more every day\n\nThey said our love was just emotion\nThat time would slowly fade away\nBut time's just deepened my devotion\nI love you more and more every day\n\nThe day you made those tender vows beside me\nMy joy was more than words could ever say\nAnd, darling, still it grows and grows inside me\nI love you more and more every day\n\nThe day you made those tender vows beside me\nMy joy was more than words could ever say\nAnd, darling, still it grows and grows inside me\nI love you more and more every day\n\nI love you more and more every day"
