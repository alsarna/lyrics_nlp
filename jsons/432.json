    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's a place where lovers go\nTo cry their troubles away\nAnd they call it Lonesome Town\nWhere the broken hearts stay\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can buy a dream or two\nTo last you all through the years\nAnd the only price you pay\nIs a heart full of tears\n\n[Bridge]\nGoin' down to Lonesome town\nWhere the broken hearts stay\nGoin' down to Lonesome town\nTo cry my troubles away\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn the town of broken dreams\nThe streets are filled with regret\nMaybe down in Lonesome Town\nI can learn to forget (To forget)\n\n[Outro]\nMaybe down in Lonesome Town\nI can learn to forget\n(Lonesome Town)"
