Will I grow old?\nHow will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?\n\n[Chorus]\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\n'Til then, it will burn inside of me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nThe truth is never far behind\nYou kept it hidden well\nIf I live to tell the secret I knew then\nWill I ever have the chance again?\n\n[Chorus]\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\n'Til then, it will burn inside of me"
