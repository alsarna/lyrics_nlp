And who is love?\nI gotta know\n[Chorus]\nDoesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?\nWhere are you?\nDoesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?\nHeyyy\n\n[Chorus]\nDoesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?\nWhere are you?\nDoesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?\nHeyyy\n\n[Chorus]\nDoesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?\nWhere are you?\nDoesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?\nHeyyyEmbed"
