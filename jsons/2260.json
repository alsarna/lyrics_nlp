    "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nJust let me hear some of that rock and roll music\nAny old way you choose it\nIt's got a back beat you can't lose it\nAny old time you use it\nIt's got to be rock and roll music\nIf you want to dance with me[x2]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI have no kicks against modern jazz\nUnless they try to play it too darned fast\nAnd change the beauty of the melody\nUntil it sounds just like a symphony\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI took my loved one over across the tracks\nSo she could hear my man wailing sax\nI must admit they have a rocking band\nMan, they were blowing like a hurricane\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWay down south they gave a jubilee\nI tell you folks they had a jamboree\nAnd drinking beer from a wooden cup\nThe folks dancing got all shook up\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro\nSay, if you want to dance with me[x3]\nIt's got to be some of that\nIf you wanna dance with me"
