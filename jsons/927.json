    "lyrics": "The Days of Wine and Roses LyricsThe days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play\nThrough a meadow land toward a closing door\nA door marked \"nevermore\" that wasn't there before\n\nThe lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories\nOf the golden smile that introduced me to\nThe days of wine and roses and you\n\n(The lonely night discloses) just a passing breeze filled with memories\nOf the golden smile that introduced me to\nThe days of wine and roses and you-oo-ooEmbed"
