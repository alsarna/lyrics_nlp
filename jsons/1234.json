    "lyrics": "Seventeen, a beauty queen\nShe made a ride that caused a scene\nIn the town\n\nHer long blonde hair\nHangin' down around her knees\nAll the cats who dig striptease\nPrayin' for a little breeze\n\nHer long blonde hair\nFallin' down across her arms\nHidin' all the lady's charms\nLady Godiva\n\nShe found fame and made her name\nA Hollywood director came\nInto town\n\nAnd said to her\n\"How'd you like to be a star?\nYou're a girl that could go far\nSpecially dressed the way you are\"\n\nShe smiled at him\nGave her pretty head a shake\nThat was Lady G's mistake, a-hey-hey-hey\nLady Godiva\nHe directs certificate 'X'\nAnd people now are cranin' their necks\nTo see her\n\n'Cause she's a star\nThe one that everybody knows\nFinished with the striptease shows\nNow, she can't afford her clothes\n\nHer long blonde hair\nLyin' on the barber's floor\nDoesn't need it long anymore\nLady Godiva"
