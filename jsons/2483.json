Lyrics[Intro]\nSugar, sugar\nOoh\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe sits alone waiting for suggestions\nHe's so nervous avoiding all the questions\nHis lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding\nDon't you just know exactly what they're thinking?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want my body and you think I'm sexy\nCome on sugar, let me know\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on honey tell me so\nTell me so, baby\n[Verse 2]\nHe's acting shy looking for an answer\nCome on honey, let's spend the night together\nNow hold on a minute before we go much further\nGive me a dime so I can phone my mother\nThey catch a cab to his high rise apartment\nAt last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want my body and you think I'm sexy\nCome on honey, tell me so\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on sugar, let me know, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nHis heart's beating like a drum\n'Cause at last he's got this girl home\nRelax, baby, now we are all alone, oh\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing\nTwo total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking\nOutside it's cold, misty and it's raining\nThey got each other, neither one's complaining\nHe says, \"I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee\nNever mind sugar we can watch the early movie\"\n[Chorus]\nIf you want my body and you think I'm sexy\nCome on sugar, let me know\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on honey, tell me so\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on sugar, let me know\nIf you really, really, really, really need me\nJust let me know\nJust reach out and touch me\nIf you really want me\nJust reach out and touch me\nCome on sugar, let me know\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on sugar, let me know\nIf you, if you, if you really need me\nJust come on and tell me so7Embed"
