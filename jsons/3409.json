And say that it's forever\nDo you think twice, or just touch and see?\nOoh, babe\nOh, yeah\nWhen you're alone, do you let go?\nAre you wild and willing or is it just for show?\nOoh, come on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't want to touch you too much, baby\n'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy\nI know you think that love is the way you make it\nSo I don't want to be there when you decide to break it\nNo\n\n[Chorus]\nLove bites, love bleeds\nIt's bringing me to my knees\nLove lives, love dies\nIt's no surprise\nLove begs, love pleads\nIt's what I need\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I'm with you, are you somewhere else?\nAm I getting through or do you please yourself?\nWhen you wake up, will you walk out?\nIt can't be love if you throw it about\nOoh, babe\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't want to touch you too much, baby\n'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy\nOh\n\n[Chorus]\nLove bites, love bleeds\nIt's bringing me to my knees\nLove lives, love dies\nIt's no surprise\nLove begs, love pleads\nIt's what I need\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't want to touch you too much, baby\n'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy\nI know you think that love is the way you make it\nSo I don't want to be there when you decide to break it\nNo\n[Chorus]\nLove bites, love bleeds\nIt's bringing me to my knees\nLove lives, love dies...\nLove bites, love bleeds\nIt's bringing me to my knees\nLove lives, love dies\nIt's no surprise\nLove begs, love pleads\nIt's what I need\n\n[Outro]\nIf you've got love in your sights\nWatch out\nLove bites"
