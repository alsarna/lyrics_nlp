Ahem!\nMe and the Ohio Players are gonna tell you about a worm\nHe's the funkiest worm in the world Alright. Sing it, Clarence\n[Clarence]\nTheres' a worm in the ground, yes there is\n[Granny]\nThats right\n[Clarence]\nHe's six feet long\n[Granny]\nSix feet long\n[Clarence]\nHe only comes around\n[Granny] when he wants to get down\nBut when he comes out of his hole\nHe sounds something like this\n\n[Granny]\nOh that's funky\nLike nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky\nAlright. Sing it again, Clarence\n[Clarence]\nAnd through all the land, yeah\n[Granny]\nYeah\n[Clarence]\nHe plays in a band\n[Granny]\nPlays in a band\n[Clarence]\nPlays guitar without any hands\nPretty good, I might add\n[Granny]\nYeah, when he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck\nEverybody wants to get up and dance\n[Granny]\nAh, get it baby\nDon't, don't, don't\nDon't fight the feeling. Don't fight it\nHey, don't stop now honey, get down\nI'm his manager, heh heh\nGonna make a million dollars\nI get it all, cause he can't spend it\nThere he goes\nGoin' back in his hole, just the same way he came out\nDo we get paid for this?\nI just wanted to make sure. We do? OK"
