    "lyrics": "Wrapped around each other\nTrying so hard to stay warm\nThat first cold winter together\nLying in each other's arms\n\nWatching those old movies\nFalling in love so desperately\nHoney, I was your hero\nAnd you were my leading lady\n\nWe had it all\nJust like Bogie and Bacall\nStarring in our own late, late show\nSailing away to Key Largo\n\nHere's lookin' at you, kid\nMissing all the things we did\nWe can find it once again, I know\nJust like they did in Key Largo\n\nHoney, can't you remember?\nWe played all the parts\nThat sweet scene of surrender\nWhen you gave me your heart\n\nPlease say you will\nPlay it again\n'Cause I love you still\nBaby, this can't be the end\nWe had it all (We had it all)\nJust like Bogie and Bacall\nStarring in our old late, late show\nSailing away to Key Largo\n\nHere's lookin' at you, kid (Here's lookin' at you, kid)\nMissing all the things we did\nWe can find it once again, I know\nJust like they did in Key Largo\n\nWe had it all (We had it all)\nJust like Bogie and Bacall"
