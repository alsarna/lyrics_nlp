We played all the parts\nThat sweet scene of surrender, when you gave me your heart\nPlease say you will, play it again\n'Cause I love you still, baby this can't be the end\n\n[Chorus]\nWe had it all (we had it all)\nJust like Bogie and Bacall\nStarring in our old late, late show\nSailing away to Key Largo\nHere's lookin' at you, kid (here's lookin' at you, kid)\nMissing all the things we did\nWe can find it once again, I know\nJust like they did in Key Largo\n\n[Chorus]\nWe had it all (we had it all)\nJust like Bogie and Bacall\nStarring in our old late, late show\nSailing away to Key Largo\nHere's lookin' at you, kid (here's lookin' at you, kid)\nMissing all the things we did [fade]2Embed"
