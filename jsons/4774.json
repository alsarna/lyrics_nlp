Lyrics[Intro]\nUh.. uh uh uh uh\nUh.. wait a minute now\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nUh, uh..\nCan you hear me out there?\nLunatics.. is y'all ready?\nLet me hear ya\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm a sucker for corn rows and manicured toes (hey)\nFendi capri pants and Parasuco's (alright)\nThe rise of Diddy and City, with one or two throws\nI'm draftin' 'em outta high school straight into the pros\nWho knows? I know and I love it when you make your knees\nTouch your elbows and break it down low to the Flo'\nAnd there you go now throw it on me slow\nAnd everytime I bust a rhyme, baby, \"Gimme Some Mo'\"\nYou say you like that, when I hit it from behind and I'll be\nRight back, yeah that's my very next line, I use it\nTime after time, when I'm speakin' my mind\nIt's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime\nI ask her, \"Who that is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?\"\nSomebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit\nBut ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this\nShould we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, hey\n[Chorus]\nAndele andele, mami, E.I. E.I\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?\nAndele andele, mami, E.I. E.I\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe can gamble to the break of dawn, nigga, money long, nigga\nPass up the skirt to talk to the thong, nigga\nSome say I'm wrong, but fuck it I'm grown, nigga\nIf you ain't 'bout money then best be gone, nigga\nI'm flashy (uh), double takes when you walk past me\nNasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me\nI drive fastly, call me Jeff Gord-on in the Black SS with the naviga-tion\nSee the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on\nI got a chick rollin' up, half black and Asi-an\nAnother one page-in, tellin' me to come home\nHer husband on vacation and left her home alone\nI used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers\nFrom Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower\nGet a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours\nKicked the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nAndele andele, mami, E.I. E.I\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?\nAndele andele, mami, E.I. E.I\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night\n[Verse 3]\nAyo, I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky\nWash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin' icky. Let\nGo off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky\nStart frontin' when the shows out, whatchu mean?!\nTwenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut, come and get me\nBig faces when they fold ouuuuuuut, is you wit me?\nDon't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut\nI keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut, then I\nSlide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy\nYou understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies\nIf you compare me to your local grocery, then\nYou'll see I got more karats than Aldi\nMore bread than aisle G, you can bag and scan me\nSure like Al B., meet the 'tics in Maui, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nAndele andele, mami, E.I. E.I\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?\nAndele andele, mami, E.I. E.I\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night\n\n[Bridge]\nSt. Louis y'all, uh, uh\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nUh, can you feel that?\nLunatics y'all, uh, uh\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nUh, uh, Uncle Phil up above y'all, uh, uh\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nYell it universal y'all, uh, uh\nUh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nUh, uh, chillin' chillin' chillin' with the crew y'all\n[Chorus]\nAndele andele, mami, E.I.
