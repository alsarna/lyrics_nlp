    "lyrics": "I want you to take me\nWhere I belong\nWhere hearts has been broken\nWith a kiss and a song\n\nSpend the rest of my day\nWithout any care\nEv'ryone understands me\nIn the valley of tears\n\nSoft words has been spoken\nSo sweet an low\nBut my mind has made up\nLove has got to go\n\nSpend the rest of my day\nWithout any care\nEv'ryone understand me\nIn the valley of tears"
