We'll meet again soon maybe\nBut until we do, all my best to you\"\nI'm so lonely, I think about her only\n\n[Verse 3]\nI go to places we used to go\nBut I know she'll never show\nShe hurt me so much inside\nNow I hope she's satisfied\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I, go to pieces and I wanna hide\nGo to pieces and I almost die\nEvery time my baby passes by\n\n[Outro]\nGo to pieces and I cry\nEvery time my baby passes by\nGo to pieces and I cry\nEvery time my baby passes byEmbed"
