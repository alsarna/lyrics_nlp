    "lyrics": "Here we are\nThe two of us together\nTaking this crazy chance\nTo be all alone\n\nWe both know that\nWe should not be together\nCause if we're found out\nIt could mess up both our happy homes\nI hate to think about us\nAll meeting up together\nCause soon as I\nLooked at you\nIt would show on my face\nThen they'll know that\nWe've been loving each other\nThey can never know\nNo, no, no\nWe can't leave a trace\n\nSitting at home\nI do nothing all day\nBut think about you\nAnd hope that you're okay\nHoping you'll call\nBefore anyone gets home\nI'll wait anxiously\nAlone by the phone\nHow could something so wrong\nBe so right?\nI wish we didn't have to\nKeep our love out of sight, yeah\nLiving two lives\nJust ain't easy at all\nBut we gotta hang on in there\nOr fall\n\nSecret lovers, yeah\nThat's what we are\nTrying so hard to hide the way we feel\nBecause we both belong to someone else\n\nBut we can't let it go\nCause what we feel\nIs, oh, so real\nSo real, so real\n\nYou and me\nAre we fair?\nIs this cruel\nOr do we care?\nCan they tell\nWhat's in our minds\nMaybe they've had secret loves\nAll of the time\nIn the middle of making love\nWe notice the time\nWe both get nervous\nCause it's way after 9:00\nEven though we hate it\nWe know it's time that we go\nWe gotta be careful\nSo that no one will know\n\nSecret lovers, yeah\nThat's what we are\nWe shouldn't be together\nBut we can't let it go\n\nCause what we feel\nIs, oh, so real\nSo real, so real\nSo real, so real"
