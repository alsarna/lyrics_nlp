    "lyrics": "For your eyes only, can see me through the night\nFor your eyes only, I never need to hide\nYou can see so much in me\nSo much in me that's new\nI never felt, until I looked at you\n\nFor your eyes only, only for you\nYou see what no one else can see\nNow I'm breaking free\nFor your eyes only, only for you\nThe love I know you need in me\nThe fantasy you freed in me\nOnly for you, only for you\n\nFor your eyes only, the nights are never cold\nYou really know me, that's all I need to know\nMaybe I'm an open book\nBecause I know you're mine\nBut you won't need to read between the lines\n\nFor your eyes only, only for you\nYou see what no one else can see\nNow I'm breaking free\nFor your eyes only, only for you\nThe passions that collide in me\nThe wild abandoned side of me\nOnly for you, for your eyes only"
