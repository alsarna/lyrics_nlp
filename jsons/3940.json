Can I have them, please?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home?\", \"Son, I don't know when\"\n\"We'll get together then\"\n\"You know we'll have a good time then\"\n[Verse 4]\nI've long since retired, my son's moved away\nI called him up just the other day\n\"I'd like to see you, if you don't mind\"\nHe said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time\"\n\"You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu\"\n\"But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you\"\nAnd as I hung up the phone it occurred to me\nHe'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home?\", \"Son, I don't know when\"\n\"We'll get together then\"\n\"You know we'll have a good time then\"\nAnd the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man on the moon\n\"When you comin' home?\", \"Son, I don't know when\"\n\"We'll get together then\"\n\"You know we'll have a good time then\"1Embed"
