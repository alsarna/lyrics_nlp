    "lyrics": "And the sign says \"long hair freaky people need not apply\"\nSo I put my hair under my hat and I went in to ask him why\nHe said you look like a fine outstanding young man I think you'll do\nSo I took off my hat I said \"Imagine that Huh Me working for you\"\n\nSigns Signs\nEverywhere there's signs\nFucking up the scenery\nBreaking my mind\nDo this, don't do that\nCan't you read the sign\n\nAnd the sign says \"Anybody caught trespassing will be shot on sight\"\nSo I jumped the fence and I yelled at the house, Hey! What gives you the right\nTo put up a fence And keep me out Or to keep Mother Nature in\nIf God was here He'd tell it to your face Man You're some kind of sinner\n\nSigns Signs\nEverywhere there's signs\nFucking up the scenery\nBreaking my mind\nDo this, don't do that\nCan't you read the sign\n\nOh Say now mister Can't you read\nYou got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat\nYou can't watch No You can't eat You ain't supposed to be here\nAnd the sign says \"You got to have a membership card to get inside\" Huh\n\nAnd the sign says \"Everybody welcome Come in Kneel down and pray\"\nBut then they passed around a plate at the end of it all\nAnd I didn't have a penny to pay\nSo I got me a pen and paper And I made up my own little sign\nI said Thank you Lord for thinking about me I'm alive and doing fine\n\nSigns Signs\nEverywhere there's signs\nFucking up the scenery\nBreaking my mind\nDo this, don't do that\nCan't you read the sign\n\nSigns Signs\nEverywhere there's signs\nFucking up the scenery\nBreaking my mind\nDo this, don't do that\nCan't you read the sign"
