(Amen!)\nThere's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)\nA gag, a plastic bag on a monument\n\n[Chorus]\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nOn holiday! (Hey!)\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nThree, four!\n\"The representative from California has the floor.\"\n\n[Breakdown]\nSieg Heil to the president Gasman\nBombs away is your punishment\nPulverize the Eiffel towers\nWho criticize your government\nBang bang goes the broken glass, and\nKill all the fags that don't agree\nTrials by fire, setting fire\nIs not a way that's meant for me\nJust 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)\nJust 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)\nBecause we're outlaws, yeah!\n[Chorus]\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nThis is our lives on holiday!72Embed"
