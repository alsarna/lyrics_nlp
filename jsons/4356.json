    "lyrics": "Secret Garden Lyrics[Verse 1]\nShe'll let you in her house\nIf you come knocking late at night\nShe'll let you in her mouth\nIf the words you say are right\nIf you pay the price\nShe'll let you deep inside\nBut there's a secret garden she hides\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe'll let you in her car\nTo go driving around\nShe'll let you into the parts of herself\nThat will bring you down\nShe'll let you in her heart\nIf you got a hammer and a vise\nBut into her secret garden, don't think twice\n[Bridge]\nYou've gone a million miles\nHow far would you get\nTo that place where you can't remember\nAnd you can't forget\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe'll lead you down a path\nThere will be tenderness in the air\nShe'll let you come just far enough\nSo you know she's really there\nThen she'll look at you and smile\nAnd her eyes will say\nShe's got a secret garden\nWhere everything you want\nWhere everything you need\nWill always stay\nA million miles away6Embed"
