    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's been seven hours and fifteen days\nSince you took your love away\nI go out every night and sleep all day\nSince you took your love away\nSince you've been gone I can do whatever I want\nI can see whomever I choose\nI can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant\nBut nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause nothing compares\nNothing compares to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's been so lonely without you here\nLike a bird without a song\nNothing can stop these lonely tears from falling\nTell me, baby, where did I go wrong\nI could put my arms around every boy I see\nBut they'd only remind me of you\nI went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?\nHe said, \"Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,\" but he's a fool\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause nothing compares\nNothing compares to you\n[Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nAll the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard\nAll died when you went away\nI know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard\nBut I'm willing to give it another try\n\n[Outro]\nNothing compares\nNothing compares to you\nNothing compares\nNothing compares to you\nNothing compares\nNothing compares to you"
