I ain't nobody\nGot nothing in my pocket\n\n[Chorus]\nBeverly Hills, that's where I want to be\n(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\nBeverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity\n(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\n[Verse 2]\nLook at all those movie stars\nThey're all so beautiful and clean\nWhen the housemaids scrub the floors\nThey get the spaces in between\nI wanna live a life like that\nI wanna be just like a king\nTake my picture by the pool\nCause I'm the next big thing\n\n[Chorus]\nBeverly Hills, that's where I want to be\n(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\nBeverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity\n(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nThe truth is\nI don't stand a chance\nIt's something that you're born into\nAnd I just don't belong\n[Verse 3]\nNo I don't, I'm just a no class, beat down fool\nAnd I will always be that way\nI might as well enjoy my life\nAnd watch the stars play\n\n[Chorus]\nBeverly Hills, that's where I want to be\n(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\nBeverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity\n(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\n\n[Outro]\nBeverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nBeverly Hills, livin' in Beverly Hills14Embed"
