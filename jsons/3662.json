    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSomebody told me\nThere'd be trouble at home\n'Cause we never talk a lot\nWhen we spend time alone\nSo how are we supposed to know\nKnow when something is wrong\nWell, we've got a way to communicate\nIt keeps a happy home\n\n[Hook 1]\nAnd no one does it like me\nAnd no one but you\nHas that kind of whip appeal on me\n\n[Hook 2]\nKeep on whippin' on me\nWork it on me\nWhip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me\nKeep on whippin' on me\nWork it on me\nWhip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen we go to work\nHow the day seems so long\nThe only thing I think about\nCan't wait 'til we get home\n'Cause we got a way of talking\nAnd it's better than words\nIt's the strangest kind of relationship\nOh, but with us it always works\n[Hook 1]\nAnd no one does it like me\nAnd no one but you\nHas that kind of whip appeal on me\n\n[Hook 3]\nWhatever you want (whatever you want babe)\nIt's alright with me (it's alright with me)\n'Cause you've got that whip appeal\nSo work it on me\nIt's better than love\nSweet as can be\nYou've got that whip appeal\nSo whip it on me (baby)\n\n[Hook 2]\nKeep on whippin' on me\nWork it on me\nWhip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me\nKeep on whippin' on me\nWork it on me\nWhip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me"
