    "lyrics": "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing LyricsLove is a many splendored thing\nIt's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring\nLove is nature's way of giving a reason to be living\nThe golden crown that makes a man a king\n\nOnce on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist\nTwo lovers kissed and the world stood still\nThen your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing\nYes, true love's a many splendored thing\n\nOnce on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist\nTwo lovers kissed and the world stood still\nThen your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing\nYes, true love's a many splendored thingEmbed"
