(Uh huh)\nBaby, just lock the door and turn the phone off\nThis time, it's time for me and you\nAre you ready? (Yes)\n\n[Hook]\nHang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'\nJust a way to say that, I'm so into you\nAnd the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove\n\n[Outro]\nClose your eyes and let the music put you in the groove\nLock the door and turn the phone off, it's time for me and you\nHang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'"
