    "lyrics": "Please love me forever\nDon't forget me ever\nJust listen to my plea\nPlease don't stop loving me\n\nYou're in my dreams nightly\nDon't take my love lightly\nBegging on bended knee\nPlease don't stop loving me\n\nOh, when I lay me down to sleep\nI pray the Lord your love I'll keep\nIf I should die before I wake\nI'll come back for you\nThat's no mistake\n\nOh, I'll love you forever\nCan't forget you ever\nOur love was meant to be\nPlease don't stop loving me\n\nI'll love you forever\nCan't forget you ever\nOur love was meant to be\nPlease don't stop loving me"
