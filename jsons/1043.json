    "lyrics": "(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet LyricsFinding a job tomorrow morning\nGot a little something I want to do\nGonna buy something I can ride in\nTake my girl dating at the drive-in\nOur love's gonna be written down in history\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\n\nI'm gonna buy her pretty presents\nJust like the ones in the catalog\nGonna show her how much I love her\nLet her know that one way or the other\nOur love's gonna be written down in history\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\n\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\nJust like Romеo and Juliet\nJust like Romeo and Juliеt\nTalk about love and romance\nJust wait till I get myself straight\nI'm gonna put Romeo's fame\nRight smack dab outta date\n\nRight now I'm speculating\nWonder what tomorrow's gonna really bring\nIf I don't find work tomorrow\nIt's gonna be heartaches and sorrow\nOur love's gonna be destroyed by a tragedy\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\n\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\nJust like Romeo and Juliet\nJust like Romeo and JulietEmbed"
