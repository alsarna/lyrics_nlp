    "lyrics": "I know baby it's hard to be strong\nJust take the good with the bad\nAnd don't think you're alone\n\n'Cause I know all your sad goodbyes\n'Cause I've been there before\nTo help you dry your eyes\n\nSweetheart\nWho love you from the start\nWho treats you like a star\nOh sweetheart\n\nWho loves you baby\nWho loves you wrong or right\n'Cause you're the spark in my life\nYeah day and night\n\nAnd when trouble a-keeps knockin'\nDown your door\nJust call on me babe\nAnd it won't be 'round no more\n\nSweetheart oh I know, yes I know\nNo matter how long\nI'll be by your side\nSinging this song"
