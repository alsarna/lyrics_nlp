(look)\nOut there doing what I'm doing\nOr try to do what I'm doing\nBut you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way\nWhat about you?\nHuh? Huh?! Come on!\n\n[Verse 1: Usher]\nI do\nAny and everything you want to\nMake your girl say, \"Oooh, oooh\nWhy is he so fly-I-I?\"\nShe beeps me\nEver since she wanna get freaky\nYou can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want\nBut she still gon' give it up\nShe likes it...\n[Chorus: Usher]\nMy way, my way\nYou can't satisfy her needs\nShe keeps running back to see me do it\nMy way, my way\nWhat I say, goes\nAnd I'm in control\n\n[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]\nBad ass, se√±oritas, two-seaters with kicks\nNew kicks, all in the mix\nI don't turn no tricks, they turn for me\nCatching bricks don't concern me\nSo forget it, little midget\nMy mind on seven digits\nBefore I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it\nI'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots\nSaying \"You, can't, front\"\nSo, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat\nAnd what I do be the Major League\nThat's why your girlfriend's paging me\nAnd she know like he know\nYou don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door\nShotgun in my drop, having fun\nWith the Don, system bassing, conversation\nAbout how she been chasing me\nAnd facing me, saying, \"Give it to me now, baby\"\n[Chorus: Usher]\nMy way, my way\nYou can't satisfy her needs\nShe keeps running back to see me do it\nMy way, my way\nWhat I say, goes\nAnd I'm in control\n\n[Verse 3: Usher]\nDon't check me\nIt was your girl who let me\nTake it this far, then, ooh wee!\nLet her have it every chance that she could get\nWhat, you think you a baller?\nAnd I ain't gon' call her, clip that\nYou can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want\nBut she still gon' give it up\nShe likes it...\n\n[Chorus: Usher]\nMy way, my way\nYou can't satisfy her needs\nShe keeps running back to see me do it\nMy way, my way\nWhat I say, goes\nAnd I'm in control\nMy way, my way\nYou can't satisfy her needs\nShe keeps running back to see me do it\nMy way, my way\nWhat I say, goes\nAnd I'm in control\nMy way, my way\nYou can't satisfy her needs\nShe keeps running back to see me do it\nMy way, my way\nWhat I say, goes\nAnd I'm in control2Embed"
