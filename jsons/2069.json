    "lyrics": "Bill walked me to my door last night\nAnd he said, Before I go\nThere's something about our love affair\nThat I have a right to know\nI said, Let's not stand out here like this\nWhat would the neighbors think?\nWhy don't we just step inside\nAnd I'll fix us both a drink\n\nMy girl Bill\nMy, my, girl Bill\nCan't say enough about the way I feel\nAbout my girl, my girl Bill\n\nWilliam's hands were shaking\nAs he took his glass of wine\nAnd I could see we both felt the same\nAnd when his eyes met mine\nI said, Who we love and why we love\nIt's hard to understand\nLet's just sit here on the couch\nAnd face this, man to man\n\nMy girl Bill\nMy, my, girl Bill\nCan't say enough about the way I feel\nAbout my girl, my girl Bill\nBill, you know we just left her place\nAnd we both know what she said\nShe doesn't want to see your face\nAnd she wishes you were dead!\nNow, I know we both love her\nAnd I guess we always will\nBut you're gonna have to find another\n'Cause she's my girl, Bill!\n\nMy girl Bill\nMy, my, girl Bill\nCan't say enough about the way I feel\nAbout my girl, talkin' 'bout my little girl\nMy girl, Bill"
