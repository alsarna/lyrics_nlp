    "lyrics": "Have You Never Been Mellow LyricsThere was a time\nWhen I was in a hurry as you are\nI was like you\nThere was a day\nWhen I just had to tell my point of view\nI was like you\n\nNow I don't mean to make you frown\nNo, I just want you to slow down\nHave you never been mellow?\nHave you never tried\nTo find a comfort from inside you?\n\nHave you never been happy\nJust to hear your song?\nHave you never let someone else be strong?\nRunning around as you do\nWith your head up in the clouds\nI was like you\nNever had time to lay back\nKick your shoes off, close your eyes\nI was like you\n\nNow you're not hard to understand\nYou need someone to take your hand, hey\n\nHave you never been mellow?\nHave you never tried\nTo find a comfort from inside you?\n\nHave you never been happy\nJust to hear your song?\nHave you never let someone else be strong?Embed"
