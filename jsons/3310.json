(Ooh)\nOh baby I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it\nBut I wanna believe what they see\nI find myself telling you things\nI don't even tell my best friend (Ooh)\nI keep showing emotions\nNot knowing just where it all stems from\nFrom time to time\nI wonder what I am in your heart\n(Sometimes you make me wonder)\nAnd even though I don't live there yet\nI'm afraid it will be cold and dark\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOh, no\n\n[Bridge:]\nBaby, am I a fool?\nCause I don't know just how you feel?\n(Just how you feel)\nAnd this love for you, Oh I can't conceal\nHit the beat now\n\n(Lost) With my feelings\n(Lost) I hit the ceiling\n(Lost) With big emotions\n(Lost) I can't be dealing\n(Lost) I wanna be with you\n(Lost) But I don't know how\n(Lost) In my heart, babe\nI can feel the beat now\n(Lost in emotion)\n(Lost in emotion)\n(Lost in emotion)\n\n(Lost)\nMy baby\nYou know that I'm lost\nMy baby\n(Lost in emotion)\nMy-m-m-my-my baby\n\n(Lost in emotion)\n(Lost in emotion)\n(Lost)"
