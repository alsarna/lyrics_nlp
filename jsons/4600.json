(oh oh)\n\n[Verse 1: JC with All]\nI'm doing this tonight\nYou're probably gonna start a fight\nI know this can't be right\nHey baby, come on\nI loved you endlessly\nAnd you weren't there for me\nSo now it's time to leave\nAnd make it alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Justin with JC & All]\nI know that I can't take no more\nIt ain't no lie\nI wanna see you out that door\nBaby, bye bye bye (bye bye)\n\n[Chorus: All, Justin & JC]\nDon't wanna be a fool for you\nJust another player in your game for two\nYou may hate me but it ain't no lie\nBaby, bye bye bye (bye bye)\nDon't really wanna make it tough\nI just wanna tell you that I had enough\nMight sound crazy but it ain't no lie\nBaby, bye bye bye\n[Verse 2: Justin with JC, with All]\nJust hit me with the truth\nNow! Girl, you're more than welcome to\nSo give me one good reason\nBaby, come on\nI live for you and me\nAnd now I really come to see\nThat life would be much better\nOnce you're gone\n\n[Pre-Chorus: JC with Justin & All]\nI know that I can't take no more\nIt ain't no lie\nI wanna see you out that door\nBaby, bye bye bye (bye bye)\n\n[Chorus: All, Justin & JC]\nDon't wanna be a fool for you\nJust another player in your game for two\nYou may hate me but it ain't no lie\nBaby, bye bye bye (bye bye)\nDon't really wanna make it tough\nI just wanna tell you that I had enough\nMight sound crazy but it ain't no lie\nBaby, bye bye bye\n[Middle 8: All]\nI'm giving up, I know for sure\nI don't wanna be the reason for your love no more\n(Bye bye!) I'm checkin' out, I'm signin' off\nI don't want to be the loser and I've had enough\n\n[Bridge: Justin, All & JC]\nI don't wanna be your fool\nIn this game for two\nSo I'm leaving you behind\nBye bye bye, yeah\nI don't wanna make it tough\nMake it though\nBut I've had enough\nBye bye, baby!\nAnd it ain't no lie\n\n[Chorus: All, JC & Chris, Justin, JC]\nDon't wanna be a fool for you\n(I don't wanna be a fool)\nJust another player in your game for two\n(In this game for two)\nI don't wanna be a fool but it ain't no lie\nBaby, bye bye bye (bye bye)\nDon't really wanna make it tough (oh oh)\n(I don't wanna make it tough)\nI just wanna tell you that I had enough\n(But I've had enough)\nMight sound crazy but it ain't no lie\nBaby, bye bye bye"
