    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCome to my door, baby\nFace is clean and shining black as night\nMy mother went to answer you know\nThat you looked so fine\nNow I could understand your tears and your shame\nShe called you \"boy\" instead of your name\nWhen she wouldn't let you inside\nWhen she turned and said\n\"But honey, he's not our kind.\"\n\n[Chorus 1]\nShe says I can't see you any more, baby\nCan't see you anymore\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalk me down to school, baby\nEverybody's acting deaf and blind\nUntil they turn and say, \"Why don't you stick to your own kind.\"\nMy teachers all laugh, their smirking stares\nCutting deep down in our affairs\nPreachers of equality\nThink they believe it, then why won't they just let us be?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThey say I can't see you anymore baby\nCan't see you anymore\n[Verse 3]\nOne of these days I'm gonna stop my listening\nGonna raise my head up high\nOne of these days I'm gonna raise my glistening wings and fly\nBut that day will have to wait for a while\nBaby I'm only society's child\nWhen we're older things may change\nBut for now this is the way, they must remain\n\n[Chorus 3]\nI say I can't see you anymore baby\nCan't see you anymore\nNo, I won't see you anymore, baby"
