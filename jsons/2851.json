    "lyrics": "Love Will Turn You Around LyricsYou can run, you can hide\nNever let it inside\nKeep living your life in the dark\nSooner or later\nThat gentle persuader is gonna catch up with your heart\nMake you a dreamer\nBeliever\nBelieving in love\n\nRight when a man's doing all that he planned\nAnd he thinks he's got just what he needs\nLife will deliver a shot that will shiver him\nDriving him down to his knees\nMake him start giving\nLiving\nLiving again\nWell, it's your mind\nThat tricks you into leaving everytime\nLove will turn you around, turn you around\nWell, it's your heart\nThat talks you into staying where you are\nLove will turn you around\nTurn you around\n\nOut of the blue\nShe reaches for you\nAnd you tell her you don't have the time\nSo you move away fast\nBut you know it won't last\nCause you can't get her off of your mind\nThoughts are burning\nTurning\nThey're turning around\n\nHow do you know when to stay or to go\nAnd how do you know when it's real\nYou don't need a sign to make up your mind\nYou got your heart at the wheel\n\nYou wanna start sharing\nCaring\nCaring again\nWell, it's your mind\nThat tricks you into leaving everytime\nLove will turn you around\nTurn you around\nWell, it's your heart\nThat talks you into staying where you are\nLove will turn you around\nTurn you around\n\nLove will turn you around\nTurn you around\nLove will turn you around\nTurn you around\nTurn you aroundEmbed"
