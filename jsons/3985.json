So?\nAnd I thought what I felt was simple\nAnd I thought that I don't belong\nAnd now that I am leaving\nNow I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you\nYeah, I missed you\n\nAnd you say I only hear what I want to\nI don't listen hard\nI don't pay attention to the distance that you're running\nOr to anyone, anywhere\nI don't understand if you really care\nI'm only hearing negative, no, no, no (Bad)\nAnd so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up\nAnd this woman was singin' my song\nThe lover's in love and the other's run away\nThe lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay\n\nSome of us hover when we weep for the other who was\nDying since the day they were born\nWell, well, this is not that\nI think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown\n\nAnd I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure\nYou try to tell me that I'm clever\nBut that won't take my anyhow, or anywhere with you\n\nYou said that I was naive\nAnd I thought that I was strong\nI thought, \"Hey, I can leave, I can leave\"\nOh, but now I know that I was wrong 'cause I missed you\nYeah, I missed you\nYou said you caught me ‘cause you want me\nAnd one day you’d let me go\nYou try to give away a keeper but keep me\n'Cause you know you're just so scared to lose\nAnd you say, \"Stay\"\nAnd you say I only hear what I want to6Embed"
