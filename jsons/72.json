    "lyrics": "(It is written on the wind)\n(It is written on the wind)\n\nA faithless lover's kiss is written on the wind\nA night of stolen bliss is written on the wind\nJust like the tide leaves\nOur dreams we've calmly thrown away\nNow they've flown away\n{Softly flown away}\n\nThe promises we made are whispers in the breeze\nThey echo and they fade just like our memories\nThough you are gone from me\nWe never can really be apart\nWhat's written on the wind\nIs written in my heart\n\nThough you are gone from me\nWe never can really be apart\nWhat's written on the wind\nIs written in my heart\n\nIs written in my heart\n\n(It is written on the wind)"
