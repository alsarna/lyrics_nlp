    "lyrics": "Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round\nGuess I'll get dressed and do the town\nI'll find some crowded avenue\nThough it will be empty without you\n\nCan't get used to losin' you\nNo matter what I try to do\nGonna live my whole life through\nLoving you\n\nCalled up some girl I used to know\nAfter I heard her say \"Hello\"\nCouldn't think of anything to say\nSince you're gone it happens every day\n\nCan't get used to losin' you\nNo matter what I try to do\nGonna live my whole life through\nLoving you\n\nI'll find somebody, wait and see\nWho am I kiddin', only me\n'Cause no one else could take your place\nGuess that I am just a hopeless case\n\nCan't get used to losin' you\nNo matter what I try to do\nGonna live my whole life through\nLoving you\nI can't get used to losin' you\nNo matter what I try to do\nGonna live my whole life through\nLoving you"
