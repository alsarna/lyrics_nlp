    "lyrics": "Sweet cream ladies, forward march;\nThe world owes you a living\nSweet cream ladies, do your part\nThink of what you're giving\nTo the lost and lonely people of the night\nOut of need, they seek direction for their life\nThey will love you in the darkness\nTake advantage of your starkness\nAnd refuse to recognize you in the light\n\nSweet cream ladies, forward march;\nThink what you're providing\nSweet cream ladies, show your starch;\nWhat's the use of hiding?\nTell the socialites to look the other way;\nIt's instinctive stimulation you convey\nIt's a necessary function\nMeant for those without compunction\n\nWho get tired of vanilla every day\n\nSweet cream ladies forward march;\nPuritans ignore them\nSweet cream ladies do their part;\nSweet cream men adore them\nLet them satisfy the ego of the male\nLet them fabricate success to those who fail\nAnd should penalties pursue them\nWhen there's really credit due them\nThey might keep a simple fellow out of jail!\nSweet cream ladies, forward march. O-o-o"
