(Arf, arf)\nI do hope that doggie's for sale\n\n[Verse 1]\nI must take a trip to California\nAnd leave my poor sweetheart alone\nIf he has a dog he won't be lonesome\nAnd the doggie will have a good home\n\n[Chorus]\nHow much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)\nThe one with the waggly tail\nHow much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)\nI do hope that doggie's for sale\n[Verse 2]\nI read in the paper there are robbers (Arf, arf)\nWith flash lights that shine in the dark\nMy love needs a doggie to protect him\nAnd scare them away with one bark\nI don't want a bunny or a kitty\nI don't want a parrot that talks\nI don't want a bowl of little fishies\nHe can't take a goldfish for a walk\n\n[Chorus]\nHow much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)\nThe one with the waggly tail\nHow much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)\nI do hope that doggie's for sale1Embed"
