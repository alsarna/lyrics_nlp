    "lyrics": "(The sweet, sweet memories you've given me\nYou can't beat the memories you've given me)\n\nTake one fresh and tender kiss\nAdd one stolen night of bliss\nOne girl, one boy, some grief, some joy\nMemories are made of this\n\nDon't forget a small moonbeam\nFold it lightly with a dream\nYour lips and mine, two sips of wine\nMemories are made of this\n\nThen add the wedding bells\nOne house where lovers dwell\nThree little kids for the flavor\n\nStir carefully through the days\nSee how the flavor stays\nThese are the dreams you will savor\n\nWith His blessings from above\nServe it generously with love\nOne man, one wife, one love through life\nMemories are made of this\nMemories are made of this"
