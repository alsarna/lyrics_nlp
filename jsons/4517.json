Fox was Alex P. Keaton\nWhen I met you, I said my name is Rich\nYou look like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch\n[Hook]\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone since that summer, since that summer\n\n[Verse 2]\nCherry Pez, Coke Crush, Rock Stud, Boogie\nUsed to hate school, so I had to play hookie\nAlways been hip to the B-boy style\nKnown to act wild and make a girl smile\nLove New Edition and the Candy Girl\nReminds me of you 'cause you rock my world\nYou come from Georgia, where the peaches grow\nThey drink lemonade and speak real slow\nYou love hip hop and rock and roll\nDad took off when you were four years old\nThere was a good man named Paul Revere\nI feel much better, baby, when you're near\nYou love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke\nI like the way you laugh when I tell a joke\nWhen I met you, I said my name was Rich\nYou looked like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch\n[Hook]\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone since that summer, since that summer\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn the summertime, girls got it goin' on\nShake and wiggle to a hip hop song\nSummertime girls are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey, like I stole your bike\nBoogaloo Shrimp and pogo sticks\nMy mind takes me back there oh so quick\nLet you off the hook, like my man Mr. Limpet\nThink about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it\nI like The Color Purple, macaroni and cheese\nRuby red slippers and a bunch of trees\nCall you up, but what's the use?\nI like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose\nCame in the door, I said it before\nI think I'm over you, but I'm really not sure\nWhen I met you, I said my name was Rich\nYou looked like a girl From Abercrombie & Fitch\n[Hook]\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone since that summer, since that summer\n\n[Bridge]\nSummer girls come and summer girls go\nSome are worthwhile, and some are s- so\nSummer girls come and summer girls go\nSome are worthwhile, and some are so so\nSummertime girls got it goin' on\nShake and wiggle to a hip hop song\nSummertime girls are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey like I stole your bike\n\n[Hook]\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer, for the summer\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone since that summer, since that summer"
