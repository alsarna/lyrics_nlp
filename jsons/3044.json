    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou might think I'm crazy to hang around with you\nMaybe you think I'm lucky to have something to do\nBut I think that you're wild\nInside me is some child\n\n[Chorus]\nYou might think I'm foolish\nOr maybe it's untrue (you might think)\nYou might think I'm crazy (but all I want)\nBut all I want is you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou might think it's hysterical, but I know when you're weak\nYou think you're in the movies, and everything's so deep\nBut I think that you're wild\nWhen you flash that fragile smile\n\n[Chorus]\nYou might think it's foolish\nWhat you put me through (you might think)\nYou might think I'm crazy (but all I want)\nAll I want is you\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it was hard, so hard to take\nThere's no escape without a scrape\nBut you kept it going till the sun fell down\nYou kept it going\n[Verse 3]\nWell, you might think I'm delirious the way I run you down\nBut somewhere sometimes, when you're curious, I'll be back around\nOh, I think that you're wild\nAnd so uniquely styled\n\n[Chorus]\nYou might think it's foolish\nThis chancy rendezvous\nYou might think I'm crazy (but all I want)\nBut all I want is you\nAll I want is you\nAll I want is you"
