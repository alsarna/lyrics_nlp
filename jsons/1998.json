    "lyrics": "Hurry, hurry, step right up\nSee the saddest show in town for only fifty cents\n\nStep right up, hurry, hurry, before the show begins, my friends\nStand in line, get your tickets, I hope you will attend\nIt'll only cost you fifty cents to see\nWhat life has done to those like you and me\n\nSee the man with the broken heart, you'll see that he is sad\nHe hurts so bad (so bad, so bad)\nSee the girl who has lost the only love she ever had\nThere's got to be no sadder show to see\nNo doubt about it, satisfaction's guaranteed\n\nSo let the sideshow begin\nHurry, hurry, step right on in\nCan't afford to pass it by\nGuaranteed to make you cry\n\nLet the sideshow begin (hurry, hurry)\nHurry, hurry, step right on in\nCan't afford to pass it by\nGuaranteed to make you cry\n\nSee the man who's been cryin' for a million years\nSo many tears (so many tears)\nSee the girl who's collected broken hearts for souvenirs\nIt's more exciting than a one man band\nThe saddest little show in all the land\nSo let the sideshow begin (hurry, hurry)\nHurry, hurry, step right on in\nCan't afford to pass it by\nGuaranteed to make you cry\n\nLet the sideshow begin\nHurry, hurry, step right on in\nCan't afford to pass it by\nGuaranteed to make you cry\n\nSo let the sideshow begin (Hurry, hurry)\nHurry, hurry, step right on in\nCan't afford to pass it by\nGuaranteed to make you cry\n\nLet the sideshow begin (step right on in)\nHurry, hurry, step right on in\nCan't afford to pass it by\nGuaranteed to make you cry (hurry, hurry)"
