All you got to do now:\n\nExpress Yourself!\n\nWhat ever you do, do it good\n\nWhat ever you do, do it good. All right...\n\nIt's not what you look like, when you're doin' what you're doin'\n\nIt's what you're doin' when you're doin' what you look like you're doin'!\n\nExpress Yourself!\n\nExpress Yourself!\n\nThey're doin'it on the moon, yeah...\n\nIn the jungle too\n\nEverybody on the floor, now\nJumpin' like a kangaroo\n\nSo let the horns do the thing they do, yo...\n\nSome people have everything, and other people don't\n\nBut everything don't mean a thing if it ain't the thing you want\n\nExpress Yourself!\n\nExpress Yourself!\n\nO, do it! O, do it\n\nDo it to it. Go on and do it\n\nYo, do it. Give\n\nExpress Yourself!\n\nExpress Yourself"
