    "lyrics": "It's gonna take a lotta love\nTo change the way things are\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\nOr we won't get too far\n\nSo if you look in my direction\nAnd we don't see eye to eye\nMy heart needs protection\nAnd so do I\n\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\nTo get us through the night\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\nTo make things work out right\n\nSo if you are out there waiting\nI hope you show up soon\nYou know\nI need relating not solitude\n\nGotta lotta love\nGotta lotta love\n\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\nTo change the way things are\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\nOr we won`t get too far\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\nIt's gonna take a lotta love\nIt's gonna take a lotta love"
