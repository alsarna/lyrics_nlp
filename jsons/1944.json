He wouldn't know\n\"Can't be like the rest\" is the most he'll confess\nBut the time's running out and there's no happiness\n[Chorus]\nOooh, Super Fly\nYou're gonna make your fortune by and by\nBut if you lose, don't ask no questions why\nThe only game you know is do or die\nAh-ha-ha\n\n[Bridge 2]\nSuper Fly\nSuper Fly\nSuper Fly\nSuper Fly\n\n[Outro]\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over\nTryin' to get over4Embed"
