    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOnce in every life\nSomeone comes along\nAnd you came to me\nIt was almost like a song\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou were in my heart\nRight where you belong\nAnd we were so in love\nIt was almost like a song\n\n[Verse 3]\nJanuary through December\nWe had such a perfect year\nThen the flames became a dying ember\nAll at once you weren't here\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow my broken heart\nCries for you each night\nAnd it's almost like a song\nBut it's much too sad to write\n\n[Outro]\nNow my broken heart\nCries for you each night\n(Cries for you each night)\nAnd it's almost like a song\n(Almost like a song)\nBut it's much too sad to write\nIt's too sad to write"
