    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLooking back on when I\nWas a little nappy headed boy\nThen my only worry\nWas for Christmas what would be my toy\nEven though we sometimes\nWould not get a thing\nWe were happy with the\nJoy the day would bring\nSneaking out the back door\nTo hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine, ooh\nGreeted at the back door\nWith, \"Boy, thought I told you not to go outside\"\nTrying your best to bring the water to your eyes\nThinking it might stop her from whooping your behind\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish those days could come back once more\nWhy did those days ever have to go?\nI wish those days could come back once more\nWhy did those days ever have to go?\n'Cause I love them so\n\n[Verse 2]\nBrother says he's telling\nAbout you playing doctor with that girl\nJust don't tell and I'll give you\nAnything you want in this whole wide world\nMama gives you money for Sunday school\nYou trade yours for candy after church is through\nSmoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall\n(You nasty boy)\nTeacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall\nYou grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right\nBut while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight\n[Chorus]\nI wish those days could come back once more\nWhy did those days ever have to go?\nI wish those days could come back once more\nWhy did those days ever have to go?"
