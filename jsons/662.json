    "lyrics": "Step by step I fell in love with you\nAnd step by step it wasn't hard to do\nKiss by kiss and hand in hand\nThat's the way it all began\nSoon we found the perfect plan for love\nSide by side we took a lovers walk\nWord by word we had a lover's talk\nOne word led to another and then\nThen in no time we're up to ten\nMy heart knew it was gonna end in love\n\n1st step, a sweet hello\n2nd step, my heart's aglow\n3rd step, we had a date\n4th step, we stayed up late\n5th step, I walk you home\n6th step, we're all alone\n7th step, we took a chance\nOne kiss and true romance\n\nStep by step we climbed to heaven's door\nStep by step, each thrill invited more\nThen you promised faithfully\nAll your love belonged to me\nNow I know we'll always be in love\nStep, step. Step, step. Step, step. Step step"
