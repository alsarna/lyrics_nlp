    "lyrics": "My love must be a kind of blind love;\nI can't see anyone but you\nSha bop sha bop\nSha bop sha bop\nSha bop sha bop\nSha bop sha bop\n\nAre the stars out tonight\n(Sha bop sha bop)\nI don't know if it's cloudy or bright\n(Sha bop sha bop)\nI only have eyes for you, dear\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n\nThe moon may be high\n(Sha bop sha bop)\nBut I can't see a thing in the sky\n(Sha bop sha bop)\nI only have eyes for you\n\nI don't know if we're in a garden\nOr on a crowded avenue\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n\nYou are here and so am I\nMaybe millions of people go by\nBut they all disappear from view\nAnd I only have eyes for you\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n(Sha bop sha bop)\n(Sha bop sha bop)"
