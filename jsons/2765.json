    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPeople say I'm crazy doing what I'm doing\nWell they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin\nWhen I say that I'm okay well they look at me kind of strange\nSurely you're not happy now you no longer play the game\nPeople say I'm lazy dreaming my life away\nWell they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me\nWhen I tell 'em that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall\nDon't you miss the big time boy? You're no longer on the ball\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round\nI really love to watch them roll\nNo longer riding on the merry-go-round\nI just had to let it go\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople asking questions lost in confusion\nWell I tell them there's no problem\nOnly solutions\nWell they shake their heads and they look at me\nAs if I've lost my mind\nI tell them there's no hurry\nI'm just sitting here doing time\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round\nI really love to watch them roll\nNo longer riding on the merry-go-round\nI just had to let it go\nI just had to let it go\nI just had to let it go"
