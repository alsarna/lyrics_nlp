I'm so glad!\n(Do you believe in love)\nOh you're making me believe it too, girl\n\n[Outro]\n(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)\nDo you believe in love?\n(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, wee ooh)\nDo you believe it's true?\n(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)\nDo you believe in love?\n(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, wee ooh)\nI believe in love too"
