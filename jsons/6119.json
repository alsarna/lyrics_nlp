City)]\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\nRight about now\n\n[Verse 1: R. City]\nIf a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side?\nOr is you gonna say goodbye?\nCan you tell me right now?\nIf I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life\nShawty, would it be alright?\nCome on, show me that you are down\n[Pre-Chorus: R. City]\nNow tell me, would you really ride for me?\n(Would you really ride for me?)\nBaby, tell me, would you die for me?\n(Tell me, would you die for me?)\nWould you spend your whole life with me? (Wassup)\nWould you be there to always hold me down?\nTell me, would you really cry for me?\n(Would you really cry for me?)\nBaby, don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie to me)\nIf I didn't have anything (Wassup)\nI wanna know, would you stick around?\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\n\n[Verse 2: R. City]\nSkiddly dong, dong, dong, dang\nAll I want is somebody real, who don't need much\nA gyal I know that I can trust\nTo be here when money low\nIf I did not have nothing else to give but love\nWould that even be enough? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)\nGyal me need fi know, aha\n[Pre-Chorus: R. City]\nNow tell me, would you really ride for me?\n(Would you really ride for me?)\nBaby, tell me, would you die for me?\n(Tell me, would you die for me?)\nWould you spend your whole life with me? (Wassup)\nWould you be there to always hold me down?\nTell me, would you really cry for me?\n(Would you really cry for me?)\nBaby, don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie to me)\nIf I didn't have anything (Wassup)\nI wanna know, would you stick around?\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\n\n[Bridge: R. City]\nTell me, tell me, would you want me? (Want me)\nTell me, tell me, would you call me? (Call me)\nIf you knew I wasn't balling\n'Cause I need a gyal who's always by my side\nTell me, tell me, do you need me? (Need me)\nTell me, tell me, do you love me? (Yeah)\nOr is you just tryna play me?\n'Cause I need a gyal to hold me down for life\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly, would you still love me the same?\n\n[Outro: Adam Levine]\nWould you still love me the same?44Embed"
