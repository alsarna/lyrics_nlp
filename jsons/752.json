    "lyrics": "Every time I faced the world\nI just had to cry\nI stood alone with no love of my own\nBut then You happened by\n\nChorus:\nOh, darling, bless You\nBless every breath that You take\nBless every move that You make so perfectly\nAnd bless Your little heart for loving me\n\nBless You, bless You, child\n\nTill You smiled and took my hand\nI felt kind of small\nBut You stood by me for the whole world to see\nAnd then I was ten feet tall\n\nRepeat Chorus and then fade"
