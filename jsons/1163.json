    "lyrics": "I see that worried look upon your face\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine\nShe's found somebody else to take your place;\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine\nI too have lost my love today\nAll of my dreams have flown away\nNow just like you I sit and wonder why;\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine\nYou need some sympathy, well so do I\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine\nShe used to love me, that I know\nAnd it don't seem so long ago\nThat we were walking, and we were talking\nThe way that lovers do\n\nI too have lost my love today\nAll of my dreams have flown away\nAnd so forgive me if I seem unkind\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine\n(Counter: And it must seem to you, my friend\nThat I ain't got no pity for you\nWell, that ain't true\nYou see I lost my lost my lost my little girl too\n\nI'd help another place, another time\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine\nYou've got your troubles, I've got mine"
