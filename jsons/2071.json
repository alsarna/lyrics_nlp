    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSaid farewell to my last hotel, it never was much kind of abode\nGlasgow town never brought me down when I was heading out on the road\nCarlisle city never looked so pretty, and the Kendal freeway is fast\nSlow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last\n\n[Chorus]\nHelen (Helen)\nHell on wheels\nAin't nobody else gonna know the way she feels\nHelen (Helen)\nHell on wheels\nAnd they're never gonna take her away\n\n[Verse 2]\nM6 south down Liverpool, where they play the west coast sound\nSailor Sam, he came from Birmingham, but he never will be found\nDoin' fine when a London sign greets me like a long lost friend\nMister motor won't you check her out, she's gotta take me back again\n\n[Chorus]\nHelen (Helen)\nHell on wheels\nAin't nobody else gonna know the way she feels\nHelen (Helen)\nHell on wheels\nAnd they're never gonna take her away\n[Verse 3]\nGot no time for a rum and lime, I wanna get my right foot down\nShake some dust off of this old bus, I gotta get her out of town\nSpend the day upon the motorway, where the carburetors blast\nSlow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last\n\n[Chorus]\nHelen (Helen)\nHell on wheels\nAin't nobody else gonna know the way she feels\nHelen (Helen)\nHell on wheels\nAnd they're never gonna take her away\n\n[Outro]\nSay bye-bye!\nBye-bye!"
