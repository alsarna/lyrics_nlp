    "lyrics": "Somewhere in the Night LyricsTime, you found time enough to love\nAnd I found love enough to hold you\nSo tonight, I'll stir the fire you feel inside\nUntil the flames of love enfold you\n\nLaying beside you, lost in the feeling\nSo glad you opened my door\n\nCome with me\nSomewhere in the night we will know\nEverything lovers can know\nYou're my song\nMusic too magic to end\nI'll play you over and over again\nLoving so warm, moving so right\nClosing our eyes and feeling alive\nWe'll just go on burning bright\nSomewhere in the night\nYou'll sleep when the morning comes\nAnd I'll lie and watch you sleeping\nAnd you'll smile when you dream about the night\nLike it's a secret you've been keeping\n\nLaying beside you lost in the feeling\nSo glad you opened my door\n\nYou're my song\nMusic too magic to end\nI'll play you over and over again\nLoving so warm, moving so right\nClosing our eyes and feeling alive\nWe'll just go on burning bright\nSomewhere in the night\nWe'll just go on burning bright\nSomewhere in the nightEmbed"
