    "lyrics": "Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye\nYes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry\nYou say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie\n'Cause that'll be the day when I die\n\nWell, you give me all your loving and your turtle doving\nAll your hugs and kisses and your money too\nWell, you know you love me baby, until you tell me, maybe\nThat some day, well I'll be through\n\nWell, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye\nYes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry\nYou say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie\n'Cause that'll be the day when I die\n\nWell, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye\nYes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry\nYou say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie\n'Cause that'll be the day when I die\n\nWell, when Cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart\nSo if we ever part and I leave you\nYou sit and hold me and you tell me boldly\nThat some day, well I'll be blue\n\nWell, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye\nYes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry\nYou say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie\n'Cause that'll be the day when I die\nWell, that'll be the day, woo ho\nThat'll be the day, woo ho\nThat'll be the day, woo ho\nThat'll be the day"
