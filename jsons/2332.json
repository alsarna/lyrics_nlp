Oh\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Verse 2]\nBack over time, we were all trying for free\nYou met the porpoise and me, uh-huh\nNo right, no wrong, selling a song, a name\nWhisper game\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd if the real thing don't do the trick\nYou better make up something quick\nYou gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick\nOoh, Barracuda, oh, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\n\"Sell me, sell you,\" the porpoise said\nDive down deep now to save my head\nYou, I think that you got the blues, too\nAll that night and all the next\nSwam without looking back\nMade for the western pools, silly, silly fools\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nThe real thing don't do the trick, no\nYou better make up something quick\nYou gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick\nOh, Barra-Barracuda, yeah\n[Outro]14Embed"
