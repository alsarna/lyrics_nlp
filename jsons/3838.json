    "lyrics": "I hear her voice\nIn my mind\nI know her face by heart\nHeaven and earth are moving in my soul\nAnd I dont know where to start\nTell me tell me the words to define\nThe way I feel about someone so fine\n\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nHow do you hold her close to where you are?\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nIt's like tryin' to catch a falling star\n\nAt night I dream and she is there\nAnd I can feel her in the air\nTell me tell me the words to define\nThe way I feel about someone so fine\n\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nHow do you hold her close to where you are?\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nIt's like tryin' to catch a falling star\n\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nHow do you hold her close to where you are?\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nIt's like tryin' to catch a falling star\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nHow do you hold her close to where you are?\nHow do you talk to an angel?\nIt's like tryin' to catch a falling star"
