Uh huh! Everythings cool, thats cool\nWe're glad you go to a swingin' school\n\nMy little chick is my heart's desire\nWell the way we kiss it puts the school on fire\n\nAh chicks, kicks, cats, cool, yeah school!\nYeah yeah yeah wail!\nAfter school we have to rendezvous\n\nGonna plan all the things that we're gonna do\nTrade bookin' for cookin' and I'll quit my lookin'\nWhen our days at the school are through\n\nAh, Bobby Ah! Ah hah! Everythings cool, thats cool\nWe're glad you go to a swingin' school\n\nWe live and love by the golden rule\nWe're gonna settle down at a swingin' school\nWell have a house and car, a swimmin' pool\nWo, wo, wo I go a swingin' school\n\nI said a wo, wo, wo I go a swingin' schoolEmbed"
