And why do they always say\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why\nBecause life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old\nAnd your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past\nWell, that's too much to ask\n\n[Chorus]\nThis used to be my playground (Used to be)\nThis used to be my childhood dream\nThis used to be the place I ran to\nWhenever I was in need of a friend\nWhy did it have to end? And why do they always say\n[Verse 2]\nNo regrets, but I wish that you were here with me\nWell, then there's hope yet, I can see your face In our secret place\nYou're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday\nThose are words I'll never say (I'll never say)\n\n[Chorus]\nThis used to be my playground (Used to be)\nThis used to be our pride and joy\nThis used to be the place we ran to\nThat no one in the world could dare destroy\nThis used to be our playground (Used to be)\nThis used to be our childhood dream\nThis used to be the place we ran to\nI wish you were standing here with me\nThis used to be our playground (Used to be)\nThis used to be our childhood dream\nThis used to be the place we ran to\nThe best things in life are always free\nWishing you were here with me1Embed"
