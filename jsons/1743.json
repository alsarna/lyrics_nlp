No, no.\n\nShe's given me a new born birth.\nI found sweetness on this bitter earth.\nShe knows the things to say to help my troubles away.\nAnd when the words she say won't do,\nShe'll try a kiss or two.\nAnd when her kisses fail to move me,\nShe'll take a little time to soothe me.\n\nShe's mine, mine, mine.\nShe knows how to console me.\nShe's mine, mine, mine.\nShe knows how to control me.\nI don't want nobody talking 'bout my baby,\nNobody talking 'bout my baby.\nI never thought I'd find another\nWho gave me more love than my own mother.\n\nShe's not just another woman.\nShe's not.  No, no.  (No.)\nShe's not just another woman.\nShe's not.  No, no.\nShe taught me the meaning of giving.\nShe brought me back from the dead to living.\nFrom a one-room dirty shack,\nShe washed the clothes on my back.\nShe's got electrifying loving as warm as her mama's oven.\nDon't know where she gets the power.\nHer love gets stronger by the hour.\n\nShe's mine, mine, mine.\nShe knows how to console me.\nShe's mine, mine, mine.\nShe knows how to control me.  Listen,\n\nShe's not just another woman.\nShe's not.  No, no, no.  (No.)\nShe's not just another woman.\nShe's not.  No.\n\nShe's given me a new born birth.\nI found sweetness on this bitter earth.\nShe's been just as close as a sister or a brother.\nShe's done things for me,\nI couldn't ask of my own father.\nI believe her love could stretch from one end of this earth to another.\n\nLet me tell you, she's not just another woman.\n(She's not.) No, no.  (No.)\nOh, she's not just another woman.\n(She's not.) No, no, oh, oh.  (No.)\nShe's not just another woman.\n(She's not.) Don't you know I got to talk about her.  (No.)\n(She's not just another woman.) She's just as close,\n(She's not.) Close as a daughter of a preacher man, oh.\n(She's not just another woman.) You know, I'm gonna make her the girl mine, yes I am.\n(She's not.)\nOh, she's not just another woman."
