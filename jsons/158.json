    "lyrics": "You made me cry\nWhen you said goodbye\nAin't that a shame\nMy tears fell like rain\nAin't that a shame\nYou' re the one to blame\n\nYou broke my heart\nWhen you said we're apart\nAin't that a shame\nMy tears fell like rain\nAin't that a shame\nYou' re the one to blame\n\nOh well goodbve\nAlthough I'll cry\nAin't that a shame\nMy tears fell like rain\nAin't that a shame\nYou' re the one to blame"
