Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSteppin' out, the weekend's open wide\nFill it up, let's blast the jams and ride\nWhile we're cruisin' around in the street\nListen up for the party in feet\nSlap me five that's the place we've arrived, it's alive\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody take it to the top\nWe're gonna stomp, all night\nIn the neighborhood\nDon't it feel alright?\nGonna stomp, all night\nWanna party, 'til the morning light\n\nMmm, runnin', runnin', runnin'\n[Verse 2]\nThe set is hot, there's people wall to wall\nOld ones, young things, short ones standing tall\nSo grab the one with the smile on her face\nAnd hit the floor and stay right on the case\nThe heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody take it to the top\nWe're gonna stomp, all night\nIn the neighborhood\nDon't it feel alright?\nGonna stomp, all night\nWanna party, 'til the morning light\n\nGonna stomp, all night\nIn the neighborhood\nDon't it feel alright?\nGonna stomp, all night\nWanna party, 'til the morning light\nStomp!\n\n[Bridge]\nStomp, step down in it\nPut your foot where you feel the fit\nStomp, you don't wanna quit\nPut your heels where you're feeling it\n[Chorus]\nStomp, all night\nIn the neighborhood\nDon't it feel alright?\nGonna stomp, all night\nWanna party, 'til the morning light (Well, well, well)\n\nGonna stomp, all night\nIn the neighborhood\nDon't it feel alright?\nGonna stomp all night\nWanna party, 'til the morning light\n\nGonna stomp, all night\nIn the neighborhood\nDon't it feel alright?\nGonna stomp all night\nWanna party, 'til the morning light\nStomp!\n\n[Outro]\nStomp, step down in it\nPut your foot where you feel the fit (Take it to the top)\nStomp, you don't wanna quit\nPut your heels where you're feeling it (Take it to the top)\nStomp, step down in it\nPut your foot where you feel the fit\nStomp, you don't wanna quit\nPut your heels where you're feeling it\n\nStomp, step down in it\nPut your foot where you feel the fit\nStomp, you don't wanna quit\nPut your heels where you're feeling itEmbed"
