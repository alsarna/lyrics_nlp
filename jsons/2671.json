    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEvery now and then I cry\nEvery night, you keep staying on my mind\nAll my friends say I'll survive\nIt just takes time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart\nNo, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart\nA million miracles could never stop the pain\nOr put all the pieces together again\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart\nNo, I don't see how it can while we are still apart\nAnd when you hear this song, I hope that you will see\nThat time won't heal a broken hearted me\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery day is just the same\nPlaying games, different lovers, different names\nThey keep saying I'll survive\nIt just takes time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart\nNo, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart\nA million miracles could never stop the pain\nOr put all the pieces together again\n[Chorus]\nNo, I don't think time is going to heal this broken heart\nNo, I don't see how it can while we are still apart\nAnd when you hear this song, I hope that you will see\nThat time won't heal a broken hearted\nTime won't heal a broken hearted me"
