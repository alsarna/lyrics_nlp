    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nA long, long time ago\nI can still remember\nHow that music used to make me smile\nAnd I knew if I had my chance\nThat I could make those people dance\nAnd maybe they'd be happy for a while\nBut February made me shiver\nWith every paper I'd deliver\nBad news on the doorstep\nI couldn't take one more step\nI can't remember if I cried\nWhen I read about his widowed bride\nBut something touched me deep inside\nThe day the music died\n\n[Chorus]\nSo bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nDid you write the book of love\nAnd do you have faith in God above\nIf the Bible tells you so?\nNow do you believe in rock 'n roll\nCan music save your mortal soul?\nAnd can you teach me how to dance real slow?\nWell, I know that you're in love with him\n'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym\nYou both kicked off your shoes\nMan, I dig those rhythm and blues\nI was a lonely teenage broncin' buck\nWith a pink carnation and a pickup truck\nBut I knew I was out of luck\nThe day the music died\n[Chorus]\nI started singin', \"Bye-bye, Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, for ten years we've been on our own\nAnd moss grows fat on a rollin' stone\nBut that's not how it used to be\nWhen the jester sang for the king and queen\nIn a coat he borrowed from James Dean\nAnd a voice that came from you and me\nOh, and while the king was looking down\nThe jester stole his thorny crown\nThe courtroom was adjourned\nNo verdict was returned\nAnd while Lennin read a book on Marx\nThe quartet practiced in the park\nAnd we sang dirges in the dark\nThe day the music died\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were singin', \"Bye-bye, Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n[Verse 3]\nHelter skelter in a summer swelter\nThe birds flew off with a fallout shelter\nEight miles high and fallin' fast\nIt landed foul on the grass\nThe players tried for a forward pass\nWith the jester on the sidelines in a cast\nNow, the half-time air was sweet perfume\nWhile the sergeants played a marching tune\nWe all got up to dance\nOh, but we never got the chance\n'Cause the players tried to take the field\nThe marching band refused to yield\nDo you recall what was revealed\nThe day the music died?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe started singin', \"Bye-bye, Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh, and there we were, all in one place\nA generation lost in space\nWith no time left to start again\nSo come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick\nJack Flash sat on a candlestick\n'Cause fire is the devil's only friend\nOh, and as I watched him on the stage\nMy hands were clenched in fists of rage\nNo angel born in hell\nCould break that Satan's spell\nAnd as the flames climbed high into the night\nTo light the sacrificial rite\nI saw Satan laughing with delight\nThe day the music died\n[Chorus]\nWe were singin', \"Bye-bye Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die...\"\n\n[Breakdown]\nI met a girl who sang the blues\nAnd I asked her for some happy news\nBut she just smiled and turned away\nI went down to the sacred store\nWhere I'd heard the music years before\nBut the man there said the music wouldn't play\nAnd in the streets, the children screamed\nThe lovers cried and the poets dreamed\nBut not a word was spoken\nThe church bells all were broken\nAnd the three men I admire most\nThe father, son, and the holy ghost\nThey caught the last train for the coast\nThe day the music died\n[Deleted Verse]\nAnd there I stood alone and afraid\nI dropped to my knees and there I prayed\nAnd I promised Him everything I could give\nIf only He would make the music live\nAnd He promised it would live once more\nBut this time one would equal four\nAnd in five years four had come to mourn\nAnd the music was reborn\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd they were singin', \"Bye-bye Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Outro]\nThey were singin', \"Bye-bye Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die...\""
