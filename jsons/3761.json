    "lyrics": "Silent Lucidity Lyrics[Intro]\nHush now, don't you cry\nWipe away the teardrop from your eye\nYou're lying safe in bed\nIt was all a bad dream spinning (Spinning)\nIn your head (Spinning, spinning, spinning)\nYour mind tricked you to feel the pain\nOf someone close to you leaving the game of life\nSo here it is, another chance\nWide awake, you face the day\nYour dream is over\nOr has it just begun?\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere's a place I like to hide\nA doorway that I run through in the night\nRelax child, you were there\nBut only didn't realize and you were scared\nIt's a place where you will learn\nTo face your fears, retrace the years\nAnd ride the whims of your mind\nCommanding in another world\nSuddenly, you hear and see\nThis magic new dimension\n[Chorus]\nI will be watching over you\nI am gonna help you see it through\nI will protect you in the night\nI am smiling next to you in silent lucidity\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\n\"Visualize your dream\nRecord it in the present tense\nPut it into a permanent form\nIf you persist in your efforts\nYou can achieve dream control\n(Help me) Dream control\nHow are we feeling today, better?\nDream control (Help me)\nDream control (Help me)\nDream control (Help me)\nDream control (Help me)\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you open your mind for me\nYou won't rely on open eyes to see\nThe walls you built within come tumbling down\nAnd a new world will begin\nLiving twice at once, you learn\nYou're safe from pain in the dream domain\nA soul set free to fly\nA round trip journey in your head, master of illusion\nCan you realize your dream's alive?\nYou can be the guide, but\n[Chorus]\nI will be watching over you\nI am gonna help you see it through\nI will protect you in the night\nI am smiling next to you8Embed"
