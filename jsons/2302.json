Don't you know?\nThat it's wrong to take what is given you\nSo far gone, on your own\nYou can get along if you try to be strong\nBut you'll never be strong, 'cause\n[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John Oates]\nYou're a rich girl (Rich girl)\nAnd you've gone too far\n'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)\nYou can rely on the old man's money\nYou can rely on the old man's money\nIt's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far\n'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)\nSay money but it won't get you too far, get you too far\n\n[Verse 2: Daryl Hall & John Oates]\nHigh and dry, out of the rain\nIt's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain\nAnd don't you know that a love can't grow, ooh\n'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live\nFor the thrill of it all, oh\n\n[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John Oates]\nYou're a rich girl (Rich girl) and you've gone too far\n'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)\nYou can rely on the old man's money\nYou can rely on the old man's money\nIt's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far\n'Cause you know it don't matter anyway, yeah (Rich girl)\nSay money but it won't get you too far\nSay money but it won't get you too far\nSay money but it won't get you too far, get you too far\nAnd you say, you can rely on the old man's money\nYou can rely on the old man's money\n[Outro: Daryl Hall & John Oates]\nYou're a rich girl (Rich girl)\nA rich girl\nOh, you're a rich bitch girl, yeah (Rich girl)\nSay money but it won't get you too far\nWon't get you too far15Embed"
