Kat on the rap so mic it\nHere's a little story and you're sure to like it\nSwift and sly and I'm playing it cool\nWith my home girl, Paula Abdul\n\n[Verse 1: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]\nBaby, it seems we never ever agree\nYou like the movies and I like TV\nI take things serious and you take 'em light\nI go to bed early and I party all night\n\n[Verse 2: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]\nOur friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last\n'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast\nI like it quiet and I love to shout\nBut when we get together, it just all works out\n\n[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]\nI take two steps forward, I take two steps back\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\nAnd you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\n\n[Verse 3: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]\nWho'd-a thought we could be lovers?\nShe makes the bed and he steals the covers\nShe likes it neat and he makes a mess\nI take it easy, baby, I get obsessed\n[Verse 4: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]\nShe's got the money and he's always broke\nI don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke\nThings in common? There just ain't a one!\nBut when we get together, we have nothin' but fun\n\n[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]\nI take two steps forward, I take two steps back\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\nAnd you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\nA two steps forward, a two steps back\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\nAnd you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\n\n[Breakdown: Paul Abdul and The Wild Pair]\nYou know it, baby, baby\nWe come together\nWe come together\n\n[Verse 5: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]\nBaby, ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long?\nYou and me provin' everyone wrong\nDon't think we'll ever get our differences patched\nDon't really matter 'cause we're perfectly matched\n[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]\nI take two steps forward, I take two steps back\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\nAnd you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\nA two steps forward, a two steps back\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\nAnd you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact\nWe come together 'cause opposites attract\n\n[Outro: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]\nTwo steps forward, two steps back\nTwo steps back\nWe come together 'cause opposites, opposites attract\nIt ain't fiction, you know it's a fact\nIt's a fact\nWe come together 'cause opposites, opposites\nTwo steps forward, two steps back\nA two steps back\nOpposites attract\nWe go together\nWe go together\nTwo steps forward, two steps back\nA two steps back"
