    "lyrics": "The Search Is Over Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHow can I convince you, what you see is real\nWho am I to blame you for doubting what you feel\nI was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew\nI took for granted the friend I have in you\n\n[Chorus]\nI was living for a dream, loving for a moment\nTaking on the world, that was just my style\nNow I look into your eyes, I can see forever\nThe search is over, you were with me all the while\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan we last forever, do we fall apart\nThe times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart\nYou followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait\n'Til I came to my senses through some miracle of fate\n[Chorus]\nI was living for a dream, loving for a moment\nTaking on the world, that was just my style\nNow I look into your eyes, I can see forever\nThe search is over, you were with me all the while\n\n[Bridge]\nNow the miles stretch out behind me\nLoves that I have lost\nBroken hearts lie victims of the game\nThen good luck it finally struck\nLike lightnin' from the blue\nEvery highway is leadin' me back to you\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow at last I hold you, now all is said and done\nThe search has come full circle, our destinies are one\nSo if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn\nYou'll know for certain, the man I really am\n\n[Chorus]\nI was living for a dream, loving for a moment\nTaking on the world, that was just my style\nThen I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper\nThe search is over, love was right before my eyesEmbed"
