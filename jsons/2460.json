    "lyrics": "After you go, I can catch up on my reading\nAfter you go, I'll have a lot more time for sleeping\nAnd when you're gone, looks like things are gonna be a lot easier\nLife will be a breeze, you know\nI really should be glad\n\nBut I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad\nYou're the only light this empty room has ever had\nLife without you is gonna be\nBluer than blue\n\nAfter you go, I'll have a lot more room in my closet\nAfter you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it\nAnd when you're gone I can run through the house screaming\nAnd no one will ever hear me\nI really should be glad\n\nBut I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad\nYou're the only light this empty room has ever had\nLife without you is gonna be\nBluer than blue\n\nI don't have to miss no TV shows\nI can start my whole life over\nChange the numbers on my telephone\nBut the nights will sure be colder\nAnd I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad\nYou're the only light this empty room has ever had\nLife without you is gonna be\nBluer than blue\nBluer than blue\nBluer than blue"
