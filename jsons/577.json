    "lyrics": "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord\nHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored\nHe has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword\nHis truth is marching on\n\nCHORUS:\nGlory! Glory! Hallelujah!\nGlory! Glory! Hallelujah!\nGlory! Glory! Hallelujah!\nHis truth is marching on\n\nI have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps\nThey have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps\nI can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps\nHis day is marching on\n\nCHORUS\n\nI have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel\n\n\"As ye deal with my condemners, So with you my grace shall deal;\"\nLet the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel\nSince God is marching on\n\nCHORUS\nHe has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat\nHe is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat\nOh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!\nOur God is marching on\n\nCHORUS\n\nIn the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea\nWith a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:\nAs He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free\nWhile God is marching on\n\nCHORUS"
