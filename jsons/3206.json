    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWatching every motion in my foolish lover's game\nOn this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame\nTurning and returning to some secret place inside\nWatching in slow motion as you turn around and say\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Take my breath away\nTake my breath away\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWatching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love\nNever hesitating to become the fated ones\nTurning and returning to some secret place to find\nWatching in slow motion as you turn to me and say\n\n[Chorus]\n\"My love, take my breath away\"\n\n[Bridge]\nThrough the hourglass I saw you\nIn time you slipped away\nWhen the mirror crashed I called you\nAnd turned to hear you say\n\"If only for today, I am unafraid\"\n[Chorus]\nTake my breath away\nTake my breath away\n\n[Verse 3]\nWatching every motion in this foolish lover's game\nHaunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames\nTurning and returning to some secret place inside\nWatching in slow motion as you turn my way and say\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Take my breath away\nMy love, take my breath away\nMy love, take my breath away\nMy love, take my breath away\nMy love\""
