    "lyrics": "Al di la means you are far above me, very far\nAl di la, as distant as the lovely evening star\nWhere you walk flowers bloom\nWhen you smile all the gloom turns to sunshine\nAnd my heart opens wide\nWhen you're gone it fades inside and seems to have died\nAl di la\nI wondered as I drifted where you were\nAl di la\nThe fog around me lifted\nThere you were\nIn the kiss that I gave was the love I had saved for a lifetime\nThen I knew all of you was completely mine"
