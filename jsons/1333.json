(He's been lonely too long.)\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\nAs I look back\nI can see me lost and searching\nNow I find that I can choose, I'm free. Oh, Yeah!\nSo funny I just have to laugh\nAll my troubles been torn in half\nI been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)\nLonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\nIn the past it's come and gone\nI feel like I can't go on without love\n(Lonely), lonely too long\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely)\nJust see me now\nMakes it worth the time I've waited\nShe was all I need to make me see, Oh, Yeah!\nI keep hopin' with all my mind\nEverything gonna turn out right\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long)\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\nNow look at me\nGliding through this world of beauty\nEverything I do brings ecstasy, Oh, Yeah!\nNo wonder I could die\nI feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high!\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)\nLonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\nFound myself somebody. (He's been lonely)\nDon't have to be alone no more. (He's been lonely, He's been lonely.)\nDon't have to alone no more, no more. (He's been lonely, He's been\nLonely.)"
