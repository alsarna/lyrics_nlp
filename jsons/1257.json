    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nFor every little kiss, there's a little teardrop\nFor every single thrill, there's another heartache\nThe road is rough\nThe going gets tough\n\n[Chorus]\nYes, love is a hurtin' thing\nOh, love is a hurtin' thing\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you're in my arms, I'm a king on a throne\nBut when we're apart, I walk the streets alone\nOn one day, happiness\nThe next day, loneliness\n\n[Chorus]\nLove is a hurtin' thing\nOh, love is a hurtin' thing\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen love brings so much joy, why must it bring such pain?\nGuess it's a mystery that nobody can explain\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you\n'Cause there may come a time you'll break my heart in two\nBut I want you so\nI want you, though I know that\n[Chorus]\nLove is a hurtin' thing\nOh, love is a hurtin' thing"
