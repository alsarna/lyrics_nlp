    "lyrics": "You saw me crying in the Chapel\nThe tears I shed were tears of joy\nI know the meaning of contentment now\nI am happy with the Lord\nJust a plain and simple Chapel\nWhere humble people go to prey\nI pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger\nAs I live from day to day\nI've searched and I've searched but I couldn't find\nNo way on earth to gain peace of mind\nNow I'm happy in the Chapel\nWhere people are of one accord\nWe gather in the Chapel\nJust to sing and praise the Lord\nI've searched and I've searched but I couldn't find\nNo way on earth to gain peace of mind\nNow I'm happy in the Chapel\nWhere people are of one accord\nWe gather in the Chapel\nJust to sing and praise the Lord"
