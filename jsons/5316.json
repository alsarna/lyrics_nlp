Say a prayer, but let the good times roll\nIn case God doesn't show\n(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll...)\nAnd I want these words to make things right\nBut it's the wrongs that make the words come to life\n\"Who does he think he is?\" If that's the worst you've got\nBetter put your fingers back to the keys...\n\n[Chorus]\nOne night and one more time\nThanks for the memories, even though they weren't so\nGreat, \"He tastes like you, only sweeter\"\nOne night, yeah, and one more time\nThanks for the memories, thanks for the memories\n\"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter\"\n[Verse 2]\nBeen looking forward to the future\nBut my eyesight is going bad\nAnd this crystal ball...\nIt's always cloudy except for (Except for...)\nWhen you look into the past (Look into the past...)\nOne night stand...\nOne night stand off!\n\n[Chorus]\nOne night and one more time\nThanks for the memories, even though they weren't so\nGreat, \"He tastes like you, only sweeter\"\nOne night, yeah, and one more time\nThanks for the memories, thanks for the memories\n\"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter,\" oh-oh\n\n[Bridge]\nThey say I only think in the form of crunching numbers\nIn hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers\nGet me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes\nI'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa\n\n[Chorus]\nOne night and one more time\nThanks for the memories, even though they weren't so\nGreat, \"He tastes like you, only sweeter\"\nOne night and one more time\nThanks for the memories, thanks for the memories\n\"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter,\" oh-oh-oh-oh\nOne night and one more time (One more night, one more time)\nThanks for the memories, even though they weren't so\nGreat, \"He tastes like you, only sweeter,\" oh-oh-oh\nOne night and one more time (One more night, one more time)\nThanks for the memories, thanks for the memories\n(For the memories) \"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter,\" oh-oh-oh-oh82Embed"
