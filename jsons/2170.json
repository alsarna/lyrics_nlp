Listen to me good\nI'm sleepin' with myself tonight\nSaved in time, thank God my music's still alive\n(Oh!)\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeone saved my life tonight, sugar bear\n(Sugar bear, sugar bear)\nYou almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?\nYou nearly had me roped and tied\nAltar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear\nYou're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly\nFly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)\n\n[Piano riff]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river\nClingin' to your stocks and bonds\nPayin' your H.P. demands forever\nThey're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home\nSomeone saved my life tonight\nSomeone saved my life tonight\nSomeone saved my life tonight\nSomeone saved my life tonight\nSomeone saved my life tonight\nSo save your strength, and run the field you play alone\n[Chorus]\nSomeone saved my life tonight, sugar bear\n(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)\nYou almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?\nYou nearly had me roped and tied\nAltar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear\nYou're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly\nFly away, high away, bye-bye\n\n[Outro]\nSomeone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight\n(Someone saved my life tonight)\nSomeone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight\n(Someone saved my life tonight)\nSomeone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight\n(Someone saved my life tonight)\nSomeone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight\n(Someone saved my life tonight)\nSomeone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight\n(Someone saved my life tonight)\nSomeone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight\n(Someone saved my life tonight)\nSomeone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight\n(Someone saved my life tonight)Embed"
