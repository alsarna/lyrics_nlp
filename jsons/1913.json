    "lyrics": "We were very happy\nWell, at least I thought we were\nCan't somebody tell me what's got into her\n\nA house, a home, a family\nAnd a man that loves her so\nWho'd believe she'd leave us\nTo join the burlesque show\n\nOh, say has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose\nHere's her picture when she was my sweet Mary Jo\nNow she's got rings on her fingers\nAnd bells on her toes\nSay has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose\n\nOh, I got wind my Jo's been dancing here in New Orleans\nIn this smoke-filled honky-tonk\nThey call the land of dreams\nOh, here she comes a strutting in her birthday clothes\nSay has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose\n\nOh baby, baby, won't you come home\nSay we all miss you\nAnd every night we kiss your picture\n\nOh Rose, one night\nThe lights go dim and the crowd goes home\nThat's the day you wake up and you find you're all alone\nSo let's say good-bye to Gypsy, hello Mary Jo\nSay has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose\nSo take those rings off your fingers\nAnd bells off your toes\nSay has anybody seen my\nNow you know just what I mean by\nHas anybody seen my Gypsy Rose"
