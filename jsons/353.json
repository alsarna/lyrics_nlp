Look a-there!\n\nYoung blood, young blood, young blood\nI can't get you out of my mind\n\nI took one look and I was fractured\nI tried to walk but I was lame\nI tried to talk but I just stuttered:\nWhat's your name? What's your name?\nWhat's your name? What's your name?\n\nYoung blood, young blood, young blood\nI can't get you out of my mind\nWhat crazy stuff! She looked so tough\nI had to follow her all the way home\nThen things went bad; I met her dad\nHe said, \"You'd better leave my daughter alone\"\n\nI couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'\nI saw the rising of the sun\nAnd all night my heart was cryin':\nYou're the one, you're the one\nYou're the one, you're the one!\n\nYoung blood, young blood, young blood\nI can't get you out of my mind\n\nYoung blood, young blood, young blood\nI can't get you out of my mindEmbed"
