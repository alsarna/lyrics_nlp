    "lyrics": "Faded photograph, covered now with lines and creases\nTickets torn in half, memories in bits and pieces\nTraces of love, long ago that didn't work out right\nTraces of love\n\nThings we used to share, souvenirs of days together\nThe ring he used to wear, pages from an old love letter\nTraces of love, long ago that didn't work out right\nTraces of love, with me tonight\n\nI close my eyes and say a prayer\nThat in his heart he'll find a trace of love still there\nSomewhere\n\nTraces of hope in the night that he'll come back and dry\nThese traces of tears from my eyes\nTraces of hope in the night that he'll come back and dry\nThese traces of tears from my eyes"
