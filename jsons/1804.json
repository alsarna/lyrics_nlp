LyricsOnce I said I wanted you\nI don't remember why\nI often wonder if it's true\nThat you could make me cry\n\nI only know it's long ago\nYou said \"I love you\" too\nBut I got one solution left\nWe're gonna start anew\n\nHow do you do, mm-hmm\nI thought, why not, na-na, na-na\nJust me and you\nAnd then we can na-na, na-na\n\nJust like before\nAnd you will say na-na, na-na\nPlease give me more\nAnd you will think na-na, na-na\nHey, that's what I'm livin' for\nHow do you do, ooh-hoo\nI thought, why not, na-na, na-na\nJust me and you\nAnd then we can na-na, na-na\n\nJust like before\nAnd you will say na-na, na-na\nPlease give me more\nAnd you will think na-na, na-na\nHey, that's what I'm livin' for\n\nOnce I said I wanted you\nAnd I remember why\nI often wonder why it's true\nYou still can make me cry\n\nAnd now it's not so long ago\nYou said \"I love you\" too\n'Cause I had one solution left\nAnd that's to start anew\n\nHow do you do, mm-hmm\nI thought, why not, na-na, na-na\nJust me and you\nAnd then we can na-na, na-na\nJust like before\nAnd you will say na-na, na-na\nPlease give me more\nAnd you will think na-na, na-na\nHey, that's what I'm livin' for\n\nHow do you do, uh-huh\nI thought, why not, na-na, na-na\nJust me and you\nAnd then we can na-na, na-na\n\nJust like before\nAnd you will say na-na, na-na\nPlease give me more\nAnd you will think na-na, na-na\nHey, that's what I'm livin' for\n\nHow do you do, ooh-hoo\nLa-la, la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la, la-la\nLa-la, la-la, la-la-la-la\n\nLa-la, la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la, la-la\nLa-la, la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la, la-la\nHey, that's what I'm livin' for\nHow do you do, aha\nLa-la, la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la, la-laEmbed"
