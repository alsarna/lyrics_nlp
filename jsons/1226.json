    "lyrics": "Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill?\nHe sounds too blue to fly\nThe midnight train is whining low\nAnd I'm so lonesome I could cry\n\nDid you ever see a night so long\nWhen time goes crawlin' by?\nThe moon just went behind a cloud\nAnd I'm so lonesome I could cry\n\nDid you ever see a robin weep\nWhen leaves begin to die?\nThat means he's lost the will to live\nAnd I'm so lonesome I could cry\n\nThe silence of a fallin' star\nLights up a purple sky\nAnd as I wonder where you are\nI'm so lonesome I could cry\n\nYeah I-I could cry-eye-eye\nI could cry-eye, eye-eye-eye, I-I could cry-eye\nI could cry-eye, oh-oh-oh-oh\nI-I could cry, I could cry"
