    "lyrics": "On a day like today\nWe passed the time away\nWriting love letters in the sand\n\nHow you laughed when I cried\nEach time I saw the tide\nTake our love letters from the sand\n\nYou made a vow that you would ever be true\nBut somehow that vow meant nothing to you\n\nNow my broken heart aches\nWith every wave that breaks\nOver love letters in the sand\n\nNow my broken heart aches\nWith every wave that breaks\nOver love letters in the sand"
