    "lyrics": "When I was younger, man\nI hadn't a care\nFooling around\nHitting the town\nGrowing my hair\n\nYou came along\nAnd stole my heart\nWhen you entered my life\nOoh, babe\nYou got what it takes\nSo I made you my wife\n\nSince then\nI never looked back\nIt's almost like living a dream\nAnd, ooh\nI love you\n\nYou came along\nFrom far away\nAnd found me here\n\nI was playing around\nFeeling down\nHitting the beer\nYou picked me up\nFrom off the floor\nAnd gave me a smile\nYou said\nYou're much too young\nYour life ain't begun\nLet's walk for awhile\n\nAnd as my head was spinning 'round\nI gazed into your eyes\nAnd thought, ooh\nI want you\n\nThank you, babe\nFor being a friend\nAnd shining your light in my life\n'Cause, ooh\nI need you\n\nAs my head was coming round\nI gazed into your eyes\nAnd thought, ooh\nI want you\n\nThanks again for being my friend\nAnd straightening out my life\n'Cause, ooh\nI need you\nSince then I never looked back\nIt's almost like livin' a dream\nOoh\nI got you\n\nIf ever a man had it all\nIt would have to be me\nAnd, ooh\nI love you"
