    "lyrics": "You are my destiny\nYou are what you are to me\nYou are my happiness\nThat's what you are\n\nYou have my sweet caress\nYou share my loneliness\nYou are my dream come true\nThat's what you are\n\nHeaven and heaven alone\nCan take your love from me\n'Cause I'd be a fool\nTo ever leave you dear\nAnd a fool I'd never be\n\nYou are my destiny\nYou share my reverie\nYou're more than life to me\nThat's what you are\n\nYou are my destiny\nYou share my reverie\nYou are my happiness\nThat's what you are"
