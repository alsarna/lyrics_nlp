    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBabe, you're getting closer\nThe lights are going dim\nThe sound of your breathing\nHas made the mood I'm in\nAll of my resistance\nIs lying on the floor\nTaking me to places\nI've never been before\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOoh, and I can feel it\nFeel it, feel it, feel it\n\n[Chorus]\nWay down where the music plays\nWay down like a tidal wave\nWay down where the fires blaze\nWay down, down, way, way on down\n\n[Verse 2]\nOoh, my head is spinning\nYou got me in your spell\nA hundred magic fingers\nOn a whirling carousel\nThe medicine within me\nNo doctor could prescribe\nYour love is doing something\nThat I just can't describe\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Break]\nHold me again\nTight as you can\nI need you so\nBaby, let's go\n\n[Chorus]"
