    "lyrics": "Girl Iâ€™m Gonna Miss You LyricsI knew it from the start you would break my heart\nBut still I had to play this painful part\nYou wrapped me round your little bitty finger\nWith your magic smile\n\nYou kept me hangin' on a lover's cross awhile\nYou put your spell on me, took my breath away\nBut there was nothin' I could do to make you stay\nI'm gonna miss you\n\nAll the love I feel for you\nNothing could make me change my point of view\nOh girl, I'm gonna miss you, baby\n\nGivin' all the love I feel for you\nCouldn't make you change your point of view\nYou're leavin'\nNow I'm sittin' here wastin' my time\nI just don't know what I should do\nIt's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over\nAnd I never will forget the day we met\nGirl, I'm gonna miss you\n\nLike a honey bee, you took the best of me\nNow I can't erase those memories\nLike a fairy tale, you were so unreal\nYou left a scar that's so hard to heal\n\nWhen you had a taste of paradise\nBack on Earth can feel as cold as ice\nI'm gonna miss you\nI'm gonna miss you\nI miss you\n\nGivin' all the love I feel for you\nCouldn't make you change your point of view\nYou're leavin'\nNow I'm sittin' here wastin' my time\nI just don't know what I should do\n\nIt's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over\nAnd I never will forget the day we met\nGirl, I'm gonna miss you\n\nIt's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over\nAnd I never will forget the day we met\nGirl, I'm gonna miss you1Embed"
