    "lyrics": "I still remember how much I used to need you\nTried so hard to please you, but you didn't need me\nYou knew I loved you, knew I always would be there\nYou just did what you wanted, you didn't care\n\nAll the cards were held by you\nThere was nothin' I could do\nAll those nights I sat alone, starin' at the telephone\nWonderin' were you ever comin' home?\n\nSolitaire, it got so lonely\nSolitaire, no one to hold me\nWhere were you when I played solitaire?\n\nIt took some time, but I stopped thinkin' about you\nStarted livin' without you, now look who's back here\nYou've had a change of heart, well, mine just couldn't wait, no no\nYou found out you loved me just a little too late\n\nOnce the cards were held by you\nNow there's nothin' you can do\nAll those nights you sit alone, starin' at the telephone\nWonderin' if I'm ever comin' home\n\nSolitaire, see what it's like now\nSolitaire, to cry all night now\nSolitaire, see how it feels to bear\nSolitaire, it gets so lonely\nSolitaire, you wanna hold me\nDon't wait up 'cause, babe, I won't be there\nSolitaire, solitaire, solitaire\nSolitaire, see what it's like now\nSolitaire, to cry all night now\nSolitaire, see how it feels to bear\nSolitaire, it gets so lonely\nSolitaire, you wanna hold me\nDon't wait up 'cause, babe, I won't be there\nSolitaire (solitaire, solitaire)"
