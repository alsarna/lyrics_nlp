And then?)\n\nAck-ack\nAnd then along came Jones\nTall, thin Jones\nSlow-walkin' Jones\nSlow-talkin' Jones\nAlong came lonely, lanky Jones\n\nCommercial came on, so I got up to get myself a snack\nYou should've seen what was going on by the time that I got back\nDown in the old abandoned mine, sweet Sue was a-havin' fits\nThat villain said, \"Give me the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits\"\n\nAnd then he grabbed her (And then?)\nHe tied her up (And then?)\nHe lit the fuse to the dynamite (And then? And then?)\n\nAck-ack\nAnd then along came Jones\nTall, thin Jones\nSlow-walkin' Jones\nSlow-talkin' Jones\nAlong came lonely, lanky Jones\nI got so bugged, I turned it off and turned on another show\nBut there was the same old shoot-'em-up and the same old rodeo\nSalty Sam was a-tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack\nHe said, \"If you don't give me the deed to your ranch, I'm gonna throw you on the railroad track\"\n\nAnd then he grabbed her (And then?)\nHe tied her up (And then?)\nHe threw her on the railroad track (And then?)\nA train started coming (And then? And then?)\n\nAck-ack\nAnd then along came Jones\nTall, thin Jones\nSlow-walkin' Jones\nSlow-talkin' Jones\nAlong came lonely, lanky Jones\nAlong came lonely, lanky Jones"
