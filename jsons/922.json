    "lyrics": "I can't stay mad at you\nYou can make me cry\nYou can break my heart\nBut I'll never say we're through\nAnd even when I shout\nI can't stay mad at you\nI can't stay mad at you\n\nI got mad at you last night\nWhen you were holding\nAnother girl tight\nBut when I thought about all your charms\nI bounced right back into your arms...\n\nI think you'll know for sure\nI won't be the one to fall in love with someone new\nI'll never say goodbye\nI can't stay mad at you"
