    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen you're young and so in love as we\nAnd bewildered by the world we see\nWhy do people hurt us so?\nOnly those in love could know\nWhat a town without pity can do\n\nIf we stop to gaze upon a star\nPeople talk about how bad we are\nOurs is not an easy age\nWe're like tigers in a cage\nWhat a town without pity can do\n\n[Chorus]\nThe young have problems\nMany problems\nWe need an understanding heart\nWhy don't they help us?\nTry to help us\nBefore this clay and granite planet falls apart!\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake these eager lips and hold me fast\nI'm afraid this kind of joy can't last\nHow can we keep love alive?\nHow can anything survive\nWhen these little minds tear you in two?\nWhat a town without pity can do\n[Outro]\nHow can we keep love alive?\nHow can anything survive\nWhen these little minds tear you in two?\nWhat a town without pity can do\nNo, it isn't very pretty\nWhat a town without pity can do"
