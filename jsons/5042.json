We should have\nbeen closed hours ago.\n\nTime to get out of these work clothes.\n\nLook, Bernard, look at my new phone.\n\nIt's got web access, it's got a camera,\nit can do everything.\n\n- Can it stop boring conversations?\n- No, none of them can do that.\nMine can. Shut up about your phone.\n\nI think tonight's\ngonna be something special.\n\n- We should open our best bottle.\n- Not the ?4.49!\n\nTonight's the night. This is\nthe stuff Napoleon would have drunk\n\nif he'd been a bit strapped\nand he couldn't get anything else.\n\nMm. Mm! Audacious.\n\nMm. Look at the robe on that.\n\nMm. Ah, strawberry notes.\n\nI'm getting caramel, I'm getting bitumen.\n\nI'm getting red wine up my nose!\n\nNotice anything different about me?\nYou've turned into a heron.\n\nNo.\n\nWait a minute, I've got it.\nYour ears are bigger.\n\nMy hair! Isn't it perfect? Aren't I divine?\n\nI'm more me than I've ever been.\n\nI can't believe you didn't notice.\n\nMen have a different way of noticing\nhair. Which is not noticing it.\n\nGianni, my stylist,\nonly charged me 85 quid.\n\nMy stylist is free.\nHe's called Manicio.\n\nI do it with a bread knife. Zip, zip, zip.\n\n- I'm feeling a bit top-heavy.\n- Ahh.\nMm. Mm. S...\n\nMm.\n\nWhy am I here,\nwasting my hair on your eyes?\n\nI should be getting slavishly admired.\n\nAh, but you will.\nBecause tonight... we go out.\n\n- Why?\n- Cos it's Friday.\n\nIt's Friday night.\n\nIt was Friday night last week\nand it'll be Friday night every week\n\nuntil we're dead and even then the\nwhole, rotten business will go on.\n\nBut it's Friday now\nand we're here, young, alive.\n\n- He's right. We should go out.\n- What are the options?\n\n- Erm... cinema.\n- No smoking.\n\n- Bowling.\n- Can't do the shoe thing.\n\n- Theatre.\n\nWhat about a restaurant?\nWe could try Yo! Liver.\n\n- I know of a party.\n- What party?\n\n- My friends John and Ann. Teachers.\n- What's the place like?\n\nBig kitchen/living room. Friendly place.\n\nRight. So, it's a fridge-centred\n25 to 40s party.\n\nChilli-shaped fairy lights,\nbeer in the bath.\n\nLots of yuppies, dinkies and yummies.\n\nLively fun but it won't\nget out of hand. Yes, I'm listening.\n\n- My hair says, \"Go, baby!\"\n- Yes!\n\n- Sounds awful. How far is it?\n- Two minutes.\n\nToo far. We're not going.\nWe've got all we need here.\n\nOh, that means it's just us three again.\n\n- We could sit in the garden.\n- Garden?\n\nThere's a garden out the back.\nI'm sure it's still there.\n\nCome on.\n\nRight, so you don't want\nto sit in the garden.\n\nWe'll just have a nice glass of wine, OK?\n\nThere's more here somewhere.\n\nOoh, no. No, there isn't, Bernard.\n\nFriday night, no booze.\n\nCrisis. What can we do?\n\nI know, we'll go to the party.\nThat's what we'll do!\n\nI am picking up a certain keenness\nfrom you about this party.\n\n- There's no other reason to go?\n- Absolutely not.\n\n- Except there is a... girl.\n- A what?\n\nGirl. She's gonna be there.\n\nI've met her before\nand I was hoping to meet her again.\n\nWe don't have to wait for Bernard.\n\nIt has to be all three.\nIf I go with you and get talking to her,\n\nthen you'll be hovering, hovering.\nAnd a girl gets awkward, awkward.\n\nBecause she thinks that\nyou and I are a thing, thing.\n\nBut all three of us go, then I catch\nher eye, peel off, natural, natural.\n\nWe need Bernard to get to my person.\n\nYou know I don't approve\nof you seeing other girls... people.\n\nWho is she, this so-called person?\n\nRowena. She's a friend of Ann's.\n\nOh, I see. Ro-weena.\n\nRo-weeena.\n\nAnd what am I supposed to do\n\nwhen you do the underpants-Charleston\nwith this insane, blind tart?\n\nWhy are you so angry?\n\n- I always get angry when I'm furious.\n- It's no big deal.\n\nBefore you move to the country\nto raise your bearded freak circus...\n\nWhat's she like?\nWhat are her prospects?\n\n- She's nice.\n- Oh, she's nice?\n\nDon't make me get sick\ninto my own scorn.\n\nDoes she play the viola? Embroider?\nIs she kind to the servants?\n\nI just know that I like her.\nAnd there's a chance she likes me.\n\n- That's all.\n- Right, we are going to this party.\n\nCos I'm trying to picture\nthis girl who likes you.\n\nAnd all I can see is you in a dress.\n\n- Come on, come on.\n- Oh, oh, wait. We can't go yet.\n\n- Why?\n- I need my kit.\n\nKazoo. Snuff.\n\nThimbles. Amulet.\n\nSwabs. Plums.\n\nIt's things to accidentally\nleave behind, near to Rowena.\n\nShe'll find them later\nand I can ring her up.\n\nCan't you just ring and say,\n\"I'd like to see you again\"?\n\nDon't be stupid.\nI don't want her to think I'm gay.\n\n- Can we go now?\n- Yeah. Let's par...\n\nDon't you dare you the word \"party\"\nas a verb in this shop!\n\nLet's p... otter along\nin order to attend the party.\n\n- Fran, get the wine.\n- Sure.\n\nWhat? Lies! Subterfuge!\n\nSeething corruption!\n\nOi! You lot! Be quiet!\n\nShut up!\n\nIs it here?\nNo. Here. You live... here.\n\nThe key won't go in the thing!\n\n- Bernard, you're using your finger.\n- Oh, yeah.\n\n- My hair. Is my hair still good?\n- Yeah, you're a vision.\n\nSee? I told you about hair power.\n\nThree blokes put their phone numbers\ninto my new phone.\n\nLook.\n\nI'm dancing.\n\n- Why aren't you dancing?\n- There's no music.\n\nSing us a song, then. You're Irish.\n\nThat's what the Irish do\nafter a drink, isn't it?\n\nWhat would I sing?\n\nMm... something about cliffs\nand a girl with golden black hair.\n\nAnd the English all being bad.\n\n- Sing it yourself.\n- Fine.\n\n# Oh, Eamonn, Danny dear\n\n- # I miss the Galway Bay\n\n# And I'll sing for all I got\n\n# And a riddle-diddle Dublin\nand a riddle-diddle Donegal\n\n# The English are all bollocks #\n\nOh, no. This is no good,\nwe need proper music.\n\nLet's have a dancing competition.\n\nI'll go first and then it's you, Manny, OK?\n\n'# Pushing up the ante\nI know you got to see me\n\n- # Read 'em and weep... #\n- I'm going next. That's rubbish.\n\nI saw you at the party -\nyou embarrassed us.\n\n- I'll have you any day.\n- You can't do this.\n\n# The ace of spades\nthe ace of spades #\n\nWhy would I want to do that?\n\nWhy would I want to when I can do this?\n\n- Oh...\n\nOh...\n\nOh! What is this... I'm drinking?\nIt's disgu...\n\nIt's like a choc ice\nfell into a bottle of bleach.\n\nIt's children's booze! What's yours?\n\nBludge. It's quite good, actually.\nYou don't even have to drink it.\n\nYou just rub it on your hips and\nit eats right through to your liver.\n\n- Manny, what's yours?\n- Delicio's beetroot liqueur.\n\n- Give us a bit. Swap, come on.\n- No. It's mine!\n\nManny, don't be a baby.\nIt sounds nice. Pour some.\n\nI'll have one with ice and on fire.\n\n- Come on.\n- It's mine. It's all mine!\n\n- I'm gonna get blind drunk.\n- Don't be silly.\n\n- You'll regret it tomorrow.\n- No!\n\nWhy are you always\nbringing the mood down?\n\nI didn't wanna leave that party,\nit was great.\n\nNo, it wasn't! The music\nwas too loud, the food was cold.\n\nThe drinks were few\nand the people many.\n\nIt was everything I expected.\nAnd less.\n\nI'm never going outside again\nunless I need someplace to throw up.\n\nAnyway, you got your chance with her.\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nOffshore wind farms.\n\nI couldn't think of anything else.\n\nNever mind. I'm sure you left\na bunsen burner behind.\n\nYou can get it tomorrow and propose.\n\nNo! I couldn't find\nthe right moment to plant anything.\n\nShe kept following me around, in\nthe kitchen, the bedroom, bathroom.\n\nEvery time I put something down,\n\"You dropped your kazoo.\n\n\"Ooh, you got snuff on your plums.\"\n\nA total waste of time.\n\nFrankly, you're doomed.\nYou and all the shy people are.\n\nNatural selection\nfavours the loud and aggressive.\n\nI don't mean this in a bad way\nbut genetically you are... a cul-de-sac.\n\nOK. OK, I tried.\nAll right? It didn't work.\n\nAt least I tried to make\na connection with another person.\n\nWhen have you ever done that? Eh?\n\nExactly. You don't actually have a heart,\nBernard. Just a shard of ice.\n\n- Flint.\n- Sorry?\n\nFlint. I always saw it as a piece of flint.\n\nOh. You don't see yourself as a human.\n\nYou... you... you're some kind of\nsuperior species, aren't you?\n\nHomo Bernardus. Scorning every fool\nwho believes in happiness.\n\nManny, shush.\nThis is the beetroot talking.\n\nYou don't know what love is.\n\nYou don't un... You don't know!\n\n- I had a girlfriend. She died.\n- And anyway... What?\n\nThat's right. Her name was Emma.\n\nSomebody you barely know\nknocked you back. Big deal.\n\nI should be living with her by now.\n\nInstead, every morning\nI look through my cornflakes\n\nto see your big,\nmad, snaggle-toothed head.\n\nSo excuse me if I'm a bit...\nout of sorts sometimes.\n\nWould you like some beetroot liqueur?\n\nYou can have it.\nYou can have the whole bottle.\n\nReally, I mean it.\nYou can have nearly all of it.\n\n- Whoa! Don't go mad.\n- I don't feel like a drink, anyway.\n\nI'm making tea. Who wants tea?\n\nThat is the saddest story I've ever heard.\nPoor Bernard.\n\nThe worst part of it is...\n\nShe isn't actually dead.\nShe lives the other side of Priory Road.\n\nWhat?\n\nBernard told me about her\nthree years ago.\n\nA year after that, I started doing\nthis exercise class run by a clown.\n\n- Yeah?\n- Circusise, it was called.\n\nWe had to wear\nthese really, really big shoes.\n\nSo the step stuff was really hard.\n\nIt was like this. It went...\n\nTwo, three, four.\n\nTwo, three, four.\n\nAnd throw the bucket of water.\n\n- Two, three...\n- Yeah, Fran, Fran.\n\n- Try to stick to the story.\n- Oh, right. Yeah.\n\nAfterwards, we'd go for a pizza.\nOne time, we talked about boyfriends.\n\nThis girl, she says\nthat she once got engaged\n\nto this awful Irish guy...\n\ncalled...\n\nBernard. The only way\nshe could think of getting out of it\n\nwas to get her friends\nto say she was dead.\n\n- But she wasn't... dead?\n- No, Manny.\n\nWhich is why she was having\na pepperoni with extra cheese...\n\nyears later.\n\n- Why haven't you told Bernard?\n- Oh, I couldn't deal with all that.\n\nCan you imagine? All the shouting\nand the blaming. No, be very messy.\n\nNo, now, listen. Oi, you don't tell him.\n\n- Don't you ever tell him.\n- No.\n\n- No, Manny, I mean it.\n- I won't. I won't do it.\n\n- Not even in ten or even 20 years.\n- No, no way.\n\n- No, no.\n- What about a nice game of Monopoly?\n\nOh, yeah, that is a good idea.\n\nYeah. Yeah. OK, all right.\nHere we go.\n\nSo, OK, Fran, you be the hat.\nI'll be the dog and, Bernard, you...\n\nShe's alive! Bernard, she's alive!\n\nFran told me. Fran knows her!\nAsk her. Ask Fran.\n\nEmma lives in London.\n\nStill. I'm sorry, Bernard.\n\n- So, you're saying she must have...\n- Yeah.\n\nI don't believe you.\n\nWell, look. She's in my phone.\n\nThat's her full name, isn't it?\n\nI... I still don't believe you.\n\nThat's her and me at her last birthday.\n\nOne of the many she'll have,\nstill being alive.\n\nHer dental records.\n\nIt can't be her!\n\nOK. Here's her birth certificate.\n\nI keep it safely inside\nthe envelope with the photo of her\n\nreading yesterday's newspaper,\n\nwearing an \"I love life\" T-shirt.\n\nSo. So... house rules as usual.\n\nFines in the middle.\nIf we throw three doubles...\n\n- How long have you known this?\n- Couple of years. Does it matter?\n\nOh! We all want Pall Mall, don't we?\n\n- Who else knows?\n- Nobody. Hardly anybody.\n\nA few people.\n\nMr Singh at the newsagent's.\nOh, and your parents, I told them.\n\nAnd I tell people at parties\nif your name comes up.\n\nWell, maybe I know\na few things about you.\n\n- Maybe I've got a few little facts.\n- I've thrown a seven! Beat that.\n\nManny doesn't know what name you\nwere born with. Have you met Enid?\n\nN... Don't let's go down this road.\n\nThe letter you wrote to your mother\nas part of the self-help programme?\n\nYou couldn't find it. I posted it.\n\nManny, you did get into\nthe Open University.\n\nBut Bernard tore up the letter.\n\nI read your personal ad, I saw that.\n\n\"Intelligent, funny, 30-something female\n\n\"seeks solvent man for sex\nand possible friendship.\n\n\"Sense of humour irrelevant.\"\n\n- I've been reading your short stories.\n- That's different.\n\nAh, but it's good. Listen to this.\n\n\"Feared by men and admired by women,\n\n\"Brendan Blake turned\nfrom the window and patted Larry,\n\n\"his barely hominoid, milk-fed gimp.\"\n\nYou went to the party looking like that.\n\nI think that covers everything.\n\n- Hello?\n- Rowena!\n\nHi. Hi.\n\n- Hi.\n- Hi.\n\nWe were talking at the party.\n\n- Yes, hi, hi.\n- Hi.\n\n- And you left something behind.\n- Did I?\n\nYou were drinking out of this.\n\nI thought maybe\nyou wanted to keep the cup.\n\nSo I asked Ann where you lived and...\nBut you're busy.\n\n- I'm sorry. I'm stupid.\n- No, no, no.\n\nThanks for bringing it.\n\nI'm really, really pleased\nthat you came round... with... it.\n\nOh, for Christ's sake!\n\nWell... thanks. Thanks.\nI'll just put that there.\n\nSafe and sound.\n\nSo... Erm...\n\n- That's about it, really.\n- Right. Right.\n\nWell, th... thanks for...\ner, bringing it round.\n\nOffer her something, you fool.\n\nOh. Oh. S-Seeing as you're here,\nwould you like some tea or coffee?\n\nOr Bovril? Or a herbal coffee?\n\n- Tea's nice.\n- Tea! Coming up.\n\nI'll help you make it.\n\nAah. Good for Manny.\n\nI'm sorry, I should've told you\nabout Emma but she asked me not to.\n\nI was too good for her, anyway.\n\nShe had arms like a stevedore.\nStay and have a drink, will you?\n\nOh, no, no. I've gotta go home.\n\nI'm not sleeping in the skip again.\n\nI'll just lie down, just to rest my eyes.\n\nI've got a date tomorrow.\n\nI've gotta look nice.\n\nCould I talk with Emma... Oh, it's you. Hi.\n\nYes. That's right. That's right, it's me.\n\nI'm very well, th... Actually, no, I'm dead.\n\nThat's right, actually, physically dead.\nNot funny now, is it?\n\nI'm haunting you, that's what I'm doing.\n\nWell, why don't you f...\n\nYou can't hang up on the undead!\n\nShut up!\n\nDid you want something?\n\nYes, I want not to hear any\nsquawking or squeaking or squealing\n\nand if I do\nI'll throw you both into the street.\n\nRight.\n\nNighty-night.\n\nEh?"
