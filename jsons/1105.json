    "lyrics": "A month of nights, a year of days\nOctobers drifting into Mays\nI set my sail when the tide comes in\nI just cast my fate to the wind\n\nI shift my course along the breeze\nWon't sail upwind on memories\nThe empty sky is my best friend\nI just cast my fate to the wind\n\nA month of nights, a year of days\nOctobers drifting into Mays\nI set my sail when the tide comes in\nI just cast my fate to the wind"
