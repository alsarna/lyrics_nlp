    "lyrics": "Look around me\nI can see my life before me\nRunning rings around the way\nIt used to be\nI am older now\nI have more than what I wanted\nBut I wish that I had started\nLong before I did\n\nAnd there's so much time to make up\nEverywhere you turn\nTime we have wasted on the way\nSo much water moving\nUnderneath the bridge\nLet the water come and carry us away\nOh when you were young\nDid you question all the answers\nDid you envy all the dancers\nWho had all the nerve\nLook round you know\nYou must go for what you wanted\nLook at all my friends who did and got what they deserved\n\nAnd there's so much time to make up\nEverywhere you turn\nTime we have wasted on the way\nSo much water moving\nUnderneath the bridge\nLet the water come and carry us away\nAnd there's so much love to make up\nEverywhere you turn\nLove we have wasted on the way\nSo much water moving\nUnderneath the bridge\nLet the water come and carry us away\nLet the water come and carry us away"
