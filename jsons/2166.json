They cough on the OG\nMake money like cake sales, cook up brownies in cake tins\nI'm making them make mills, I'm taking no payments\nYour girl stop me and said this\n\"I'm a fan of your latest. Please take me to places\nI'm so sick of this small town I'm starting to hate it\"\nSo i get her on tour bus, I'm getting the munchies\nAnd now that we talk lots she making me toasties\nKERMIT\nI hope my kid got problems, so we got something in common\nNot a good creature to never have problems 'cause then they pretend like they got them\nI hope my kid smoke drugs so he can act all smug until he's 21 with a kid of his own and a whole lot of debt and a pay-as-you-go\nI hope my kid not American when they eventually shoot up a school again\nEmma Gonzales for president making for change like it's good again\nHope my kid misunderstood. I hope my kid was a hood and I hope my kid always knows I love him as much as the first one that goes\n\nLANK (CHORUS):\nSuck on my ding dong, put on my long johns\nFly to Hong Kong, link up with Cheech Chong\nSmack you like ping pong, if you call me that's ring wrong\nSinging my swan song, you cannot play me like mahjong\n\nDJ MATTY BOI:\n\nI hope my daughter's tits droopy, so when I doggy like snoopy\nDisobedient child get a bitch slap\nI hope my nephew dyslexic, anorexic and neglected\nSo he can't spell my name when he tells the authorities about the thing with my big dick\nAnd a hickory dickory dock\nHow many inches belong to my cock. About three or four\nYour girl still want more but she like 34\nRoar"
