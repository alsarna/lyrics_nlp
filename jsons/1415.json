    "lyrics": "The Look Of Love LyricsThe look, of love is in your eyes\nA look that time can't disguise\nThe look of love is saying so much more than just words could ever say\nAnd what my heart has heard, well it takes my breath away\n\nI can hardly wait to hold you\nFeel my arms around you\nHow long I have waited\nWaited just to love you\nNow that I have found you\nYou've got the look of love\nIt's on your face\nA look that time can't erase\nBe mine, tonight\nLet this be just the start\nOf so many nights like this\nLet's take a lover's vow\nAnd then seal it with a kiss\nI can hardly wait to hold you\nFeel my arms around you\nHow long I have waited\nWaited just to love you\nNow that I have found you\nDon't ever go (repeat and fade)Embed"
