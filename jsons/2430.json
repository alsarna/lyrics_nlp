    "lyrics": "Imaginary lovers never turn you down\nWhen all the others turn you away, they're around\nIt's my private pleasure, midnight fantasy\nSomeone to share my wildest dreams with me\nImaginary lover, you're mine anytime\nImaginary lovers, oh yeah\n\nWhen ordinary lovers don't feel what you feel\nAnd real life situations lose their thrill\nImagination's unreal\nImaginary lover, imaginary lover\nYou're mine anytime\n\nImaginary lovers never disagree\nThey always care\nThey're always there when\nYou need satisfaction guaranteed\nImaginary lover, imaginary lover\nYou're mine all the time\nMy imaginary lover\nYou're mine anytime"
