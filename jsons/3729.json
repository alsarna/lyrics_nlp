Light it up!\nI can still feel the touch\nOf your thin blue jeans\nRunning down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby\nOh, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the rhythm of my heart\nIs beating like a drum\nWith the words, \"I love you\" rolling off my tongue\nNo, never will I roam\nFor I know my place is home\nWhere the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing\nI'll be sailing\nI'll be sailing\nI will\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, I've got lightning in my veins\nShifting like the handle of a slot machine\nLove may still exist in another place\nI'm just yanking back the handle\nNo expression on my face\n[Chorus]\nOh, the rhythm of my heart\nIs beating like a drum\nWith the words, \"I love you\" rolling off my tongue\nNo, never will I roam\nFor I know my place is home\nWhere the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing\nOh, the rhythm of my heart\nIs beating like a drum\nWith the words, \"I love you\" rolling off my tongue\nNo, never will I roam\nFor I know my place is home\nWhere the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing\nThe rhythm of my heart\nIs beating like a drum\nWith the words, \"I love you\"\nRolling off my tongue\nNo, never will I roam\nFor I know my place is home\nWhere the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing\nOoh, hoo-hoo, oohEmbed"
