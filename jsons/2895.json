    "lyrics": "Never Gonna Let You Go LyricsI was as wrong as I could be\nTo let you get away from me\nI'll regret that move for as long as I'm living\nBut now that I've come to see the light\n\nAll I wanna do is make things right\nSo just say the word\nAnd tell me that I'm forgiven\n\nYou and me\nWe're gonna be better than we were before\nI loved you then\nBut now I intend to open up\nAnd love you even more\nThis time you can be sure\nI'm never gonna let you go\nI'm gonna hold you in my arms forever\nGonna try and make up for all the times\nI hurt you so\n\nGonna hold your body close to mine\nFrom this day on\nWe're gonna be together\nOh, I swear this time\nI'm never gonna let you go\n\nLooking back now\nIt seems so clear\nI had it all when you were here\nOh, you gave it all\nAnd I took it for granted\n\nBut if there's some feeling left in you\nSome flicker of love\nThat still shines through\nLet's talk it out\nLet's talk about second chances\n\nWait and see\nIt's gonna be sweeter than it was before\nI gave some then\nBut now I intend to dedicate myself to giving more\nThis time you can be sure\nI'm never gonna let you go\nI'm gonna hold you in my arms forever\nGonna try and make up for all the times\nI hurt you so\n\nGonna hold your body close to mine\nFrom this day on\nWe're gonna be together\nOh, I swear this time\nI'm never gonna let you go\n\nOh\nSo if you'll just say\nYou want me too\n\nI'm never gonna let you go\nI'm gonna hold you in my arms forever\nGonna try and make up for all the times\nI hurt you so\n\nGonna hold your body close to mine\nFrom this day on\nWe're gonna be together\nOh, I swear this time\nI'm never gonna let you go\nNever gonna let you go\nHold you in my arms forever\nGonna try and make up for all the times\nI hurt you so\n\nHold your body close to mine\nOh, we're gonna be together\nOh, I swear this time\nI'm never gonna let you goEmbed"
