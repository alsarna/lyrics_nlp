Joe's\nOn R&R from Cuba and Russia\nThe smell of sex, the smell of suicide\nAll these dream things I can't keep inside\n[Chorus]\nUndercover\nKeep it all out of sight\nUndercover of the night\n\n[Outro]\nUndercover of the night\nUndercover of the night\nUndercover, undercover\nUndercover of the night"
