Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand\n(Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be\n(Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because\nI wanna love you the best that... the best that I can\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee I was wasted and I was a-wastin' time\n'Til I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes\nThen I stood up and then I screamed aloud\nI don't wanna be part of your problems, don't wanna be part of your crowd, no\n\n[Refrain]\n'Cause I got a hand for you\n(I got a hand for you)\n'Cause I wanna run with you\n(Ah, won't you let me run with you?)\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand\n(Hold my hand) I'll take you to the promised land\n(Hold my hand) Maybe we can't change the world, but\nI wanna love you the best that... the best that I can, yeah\n[Interlude]\nOh\nLet me run, won't you let me run, run, run, run\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand\n(Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be\n(Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because\nI... oh no-no, no no no\n\n[Chorus]\n(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand\n(Hold my hand) I'll make it to a promised land\n(Hold my hand) Maybe we can't change the world, but\nI wanna love you the best that... the best that I can\n\n[Outro]\nOh\nThe best that I can10Embed"
