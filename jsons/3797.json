    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLife's like a road that you travel on\nWhen there's one day here and the next day gone\nSometimes you bend, sometimes you stand\nSometimes you turn your back to the wind\nThere's a world outside every darkened door\nWhere blues won't haunt you anymore\nWhere the brave are free and lovers soar\nCome ride with me to the distant shore\nWe won't hesitate, break down the garden gate\nThere's not much time left today\n\n[Chorus]\nLife is a highway\nI want to ride it all night long\nIf you're going my way\nI want to drive it all night long\n\n[Verse 2]\nThrough all the cities and all these towns\nIt's in my blood and it's all around\nI love you now like I loved you then\nThis is the road and these are the hills\nFrom Mozambique to those Memphis nights\nThe Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights\nKnock me down, get back up again\nYou're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man\nThere's no load I can't hold\nThe roads are rough, this I know\nI'll be there when the light comes in\nJust tell 'em we're survivors\n\n[Chorus]\nLife is a highway\nI want to ride it all night long\nIf you're going my way\nI want to drive it all night long, hmm\nLife is a highway\nI want to ride it all night long\n(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)\nIf you're going my way\nI want to drive it all night long\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere was a distance between you and I\nA misunderstanding once\nBut now we look it in the eye\nOh\n\n[Harmonica Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nThere ain't no load that I can't hold\nRoad so rough, this I know\nI'll be there when the light comes in\nJust tell 'em we're survivors\n[Chorus]\nLife is a highway\nI want to ride it all night long (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah)\nIf you're going my way\nI want to drive it all night long (Yeah, yeah)\n(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)\nLife is a highway\nI want to ride it all night long\nIf you're going my way\nI want to drive it all night long\n(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)\nLife is a highway\nI want to ride it all night long (Yeah, yeah)\nIf you're going my way\nI want to drive it all night long, ooh\n(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)"
