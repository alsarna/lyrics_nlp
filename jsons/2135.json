    "lyrics": "You make me laugh\nCause your eyes, they light the night\nThey look right though me. La la la la\nYou bashful boy\nYou're hiding something sweet\nPlease give it to me, yeah, to me\n\nWo oh oh\nTalk to me some more\nYou don't have to go\nYou're the Poetry Man\nYou make things all rhyme\n\nOoh yeah, yeah\nYou are a genie\nAll I ask for is your smile\nEach time I rub the lamp. La la la la\nWhen I am with you\nI have a giggling teen-age crush\nThen I'm a sultry vamp\n\nWo oh talk to me some more\nYou don't have to go\nYou're the Poetry Man\nYou make things all rhyme\nOoh yeah, yeah\nTalk to me somemore\nYou don't have to go\nYou're the poetry man\nYou make things all rhyme\n\nSo once again\nIt's time to say, so long\nAnd so recall the lull of life\nYou're going home now\nHome's that place somewhere you go each day\nTo see your wife\n\nWo oh Talk to me some more\nYou know that you don't have to go\nYou're the Poetry Man\nYou make things all rhyme"
