What a Feeling Lyrics[Intro]\nFirst, when there's nothing, but a slow glowing dream\nThat your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind\nAll alone, I have cried, silent tears full of pride\nIn a world made of steel, made of stone\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm\nWrap around, take a hold of my heart\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat a feelin', being's believin'\nI can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life\nTake your passion, and make it happen\nPictures come alive, you can dance right through your life\n[Verse 2]\nNow I hear the music, close my eyes, I am rhythm\nIn a flash, it takes hold of my heart\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat a feelin', being's believin'\nI can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life\nTake your passion, and make it happen\nPictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life\n\n[Interlude]\nWhat a feelin'\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus / Outro]\nWhat a feelin', being's believin' (I am music now, I am rhythm now)\nPictures come alive, you can dance right through your life\n\nWhat a feelin', what a feelin'\n(I can really have it all, pictures come alive when I call)\nI can have it all, have it all\n(I can really have it all, pictures come alive when I call)\n\n(Call, call, call, what a feelin')\nI can have it all\nBeing's believin' (Being's believin', take your passion)\nMake it happen, what a feelin' (Make it happen, what a feelin')6Embed"
