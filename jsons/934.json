    "lyrics": "Busted Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYeah, my bills are all due and the baby needs shoes but I'm busted\nCotton is down to a quarter a pound but I'm busted right now\nI got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay\nA big stack of bills that gets bigger each day\nThe county's gonna haul my belongings away 'cause I'm busted right now\nOh, yes I am\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I went to my brother to ask for a loan 'cause I was busted\nI hate to beg like a dog without a bone but I'm busted, I tell ya\nMy brother said, \"There ain't a thing I can do\nMy wife and my kids are all down with the flu\nAnd I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted myself\"\nWell, that's what he told me\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, I am no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted\nThe food that we canned the last summer is gone and I'm busted right now\nWell, the fields all are bare and the cotton won't grow\nMe and my family got to pack up and go\nI'll make a living, where, I don't know 'cause I'm busted today\n\n[Outro]\nY'all know I'm broke\nI ain't got no money\nI'm talkin' 'bout empty pockets\nAh, forget it\nAh, to hell with it\nYeahEmbed"
