    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy bills are all due and the baby needs shoes and I'm busted\nCotton is down to a quarter a pound but I'm busted\nI got cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay\nA big stack of bills that gets bigger each day\nThe county's gonna haul my belongings away 'cause I'm busted\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went to my brother to ask for a loan 'cause I was busted\nI hate to beg like a dog without a bone but I'm busted\nMy brother said, \"There ain't a thing I can do\nMy wife and my kids are all down with the flu\nAnd I was just thinking about calling on you and I'm busted\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I am no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted\nThe food that we canned the last summer is gone and I'm busted\nThe fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow\nMe and my family got to pack up and go\nBut I'll make a living, my Lord, just where, I don't know 'cause I'm busted\n\n[Outro]\nI'm broke\nNo bread\nI mean, like, nothing\nForget it"
