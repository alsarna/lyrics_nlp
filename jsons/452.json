Goode Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDeep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans\nWay back up in the woods among the evergreens\nThere stood a log cabin made of earth and wood\nWhere lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode\nWho never ever learned to read or write so well\nBut he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell\n\n[Chorus]\nGo, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nJohnny B. Goode\n[Verse 2]\nHe used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack\nGo sit beneath the tree by the railroad track\nOh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade\nStrumming with the rhythm that the drivers made\nPeople passing by they would stop and say\nOh my, but that little country boy could play\n\n[Chorus]\nGo, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nGo Johnny go, go\nJohnny B. Goode\n\n[Verse 3]\nHis mother told him \"Someday you will be a man\nAnd you will be the leader of a big old band\nMany people coming from miles around\nTo hear you play your music when the sun go down\nMaybe someday your name will be in lights\nSaying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'\"\n\n[Chorus]\nGo, go\nGo Johnny go\nGo go go, Johnny go\nOh go go, Johnny go\nOh go go, Johnny go\nGo, Johnny B. Goode26Embed"
