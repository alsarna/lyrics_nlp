    "lyrics": "Stranger In Paradise LyricsTake my hand\nI'm a stranger in paradise\nAll lost in a wonderland\nA stranger in paradise\nIf I stand starry-eyed\nThat's a danger in paradise\nFor mortals who stand beside an angel like you\n\nI saw your face and I ascended\nOut of the commonplace into the rare\nSomewhere in space I hang suspended\nUntil I know there's a chance that you care\n\nWon't you answer the fervent prayer\nOf a stranger in paradise\nDon't send me in dark despair\nFrom all that I hunger for\nBut open your angel's arms\nTo the stranger in paradise\nAnd tell him that he need be\nA stranger no more\n\nTake my handEmbed"
