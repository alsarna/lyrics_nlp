Morgan) (#7), Dinah Shore (#15), Dick Jacobs (#17), and\nDavid Carroll (#56)\n- from the soundtrack of the film \"Love In the Afternoon\" starring Gary Cooper\nAudrey Hepburn, and Maurice Chevalier\n- English words by Dick Manning and Music by F.D. Marchetti\n(Fascination turned to love)\nIt was fascination, I know\nAnd it might have ended right there at the start\nJust a passing glance, just a brief romance\nAnd I might have gone on my way empty-hearted\nIt was fascination, I know\nSeeing you alone with the moonlight above\nThen I touched your hand and next moment I kissed you\nFascination turned to love"
