    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'd say love was a magical thing\nI'd say love would keep us from pain\nHad I been there, had I been there\nI would promise you all of my life\nBut to lose you would cut like a knife\nSo I don't dare, no I don't dare\nCause I've never come close in all of these years\nYou are the only one to stop my tears\nAnd I'm so scared, I'm so scared\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake me back in time maybe I can forget\nTurn a different corner and we never would have met\nWould you care\nI don't understand it, for you it's a breeze\nLittle by little you've brought me to my knees\nDon't you care\nNo I've never come close in all of these years\nYou are the only one to stop my tears\nI'm so scared of this love\nAnd if all that there is, is this fear of being used\nI should go back to being lonely and confused\nIf I could, I would, I swear"
