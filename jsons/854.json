    "lyrics": "She's Venus in blue jeans\nMona Lisa with a pony tail\nShe's a walking talking work of art\nShe's the girl who stole my heart\n\nMy Venus in blue jeans\nIs the Cinderella I adore\nShe's my very special angel too\nA fairy tale come true\n\nThey say there's 7 wonders in the world\nBut what they say is out of date\nThere's more than 7 wonders in the world\nI just met number 8\n\nMy Venus in blue jeans\nIs everything I hoped she be\nA teenage goddess from above\nAnd she belongs to me\n(repeat)"
