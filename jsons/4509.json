(Someday will)\n[Verse 3]\nSo far\nSo long\nSo far away\nSo far\nSo wrong\nSo far away away away\n\n[Verse 1 repeated]\nSomeday, when my life has passed me by\nI'll lay around and wonder why, you were always there for me\nOne way, in the eyes of a passer by\nI'll look around for another try and they'll fade away\n\n[Outro]\nAnd they fade away (repeats many times until it fades out)"
