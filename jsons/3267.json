I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeems so long I've been waiting\nStill don't know what for\nThere's no point in escaping\nI don't worry anymore\nI can't come out to find you\nI don't like to go outside\nThey can turn off my feelings\nLike they're turning off the light\n\n[Refrain 2]\nBut, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\nOh, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\n[Chorus]\nSo take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home, oh lord\n\n[bridge]\n'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life\nAnd I can say to you\n\n[Verse 3]\nTake that look of worry\nMine's an ordinary life\nWorking when it's daylight\nAnd sleeping when it's night\nI've got no far horizons\nI don't wish upon a star\nThey don't think that I listen\nOh, but I know who they are\n\n[Refrain 3]\nAnd, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\nOh, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\n[Chorus]\nSo take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home, oh Lord\n\n[Bridge (variant)]\nWell I've been a prisoner all my life\nAnd I can say to you, but I don't remember\n\n[Outro]\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember..."
