I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeems so long I've been waiting, still don't know what for\nThere's no point in escaping, I don't worry anymore\nI can't come out to find you, I don't like to go outside\nThey can turn off my feelings like they're turning off the light\n[Refrain 2]\nBut, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\nOh, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\n\n[Chorus]\nSo take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home, oh Lord\n\n[Bridge]\n'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life, and I can say to you\n\n[Verse 3]\nTake that look of worry, mine's an ordinary life\nWorking when it's daylight, and sleeping when it's night\nI've got no far horizons, I don't wish upon a star\nThey don't think that I listen, oh, but I know who they are\n\n[Refrain 3]\nAnd, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\nOh, I... I don't mind\nNo, I... I don't mind\n[Chorus]\nSo take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home, oh Lord\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, I've been a prisoner all my life, and I can say to you\nBut I don't remember\n\n[Outro]\nTake, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember, take, take me home\n'Cause I don't remember...9Embed"
