    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been up to my neck working six days a week\nWearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet\nBeen dreaming of getting away since I don't know\nAin't no better time than now for Mexico\n\n[Chorus]\nNo shoes, no shirt, no problems\nBlues what blues hey I forgot them\nThe sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom\nAnd no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!\nNo problems\n\n[Verse 2]\nWant a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea\nWant to look thru my shades and see you there with me\nWant to soak up life for a while\nIn laid back mode\nNo boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code\n\n[Chorus]\nNo shoes, no shirt, no problems\nBlues what blues hey I forgot them\nThe sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom\nAnd no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!\n[Outro]\nBabe let's get packed tank tops and flip flops if you got them\nNo shoes, no shirt, no problems\nNo problems"
