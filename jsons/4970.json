Hey, I forgot 'em\nThe sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom\nAnd no shoes, no shirt and no problems\nNo problems\n\n[Verse 2]\nWant a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea\nWanna look through my shades and see you there with me\nWanna soak up life for a while in laid back mode\nNo boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code\n[Chorus]\nNo shoes, no shirt and no problems\nBlues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em\nThe sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom\nAnd no shoes, and no shirt and no problems\nBabe, let's get packed tank tops and flip-flops if you got 'em\nNo shoes, and no shirt and no problems\nNo problems1Embed"
