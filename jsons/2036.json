    "lyrics": "Tell me again, mommy\n\nYou and me against the world\nSometimes it feels like you and me against the world\nWhen all the others turn their backs and walk away\nYou can count on me to stay\n\nRemember when the circus came to town\nAnd you were frightened by the clown\nWasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew\nSomeone who was big and strong and looking out for you\n\nAnd me against the world\nSometimes it feels like you and me against the world\nAnd for all the times we've cried\nI always felt that God was on our side\n\nAnd when one of us is gone\nAnd one of us is left to carry on\nThen remembering will have to do\nOur memories alone will get us through\nThink about the days of me and you\nYou and me against the world\n\nAnd when one of us is gone\nAnd one of us is left to carry on\nThen remembering will have to do\nOur memories alone will get us through\nThink about the days of me and you\nYou and me against the world\nI love you, mommy\nI love you too, baby"
