    "lyrics": "For The Love Of Him LyricsWhen he opens the door says \"I'm home\"\nBe aware of the look in his eyes\nThey tell you the mood he's in\nWhat kind of day it's been\nFor the love of him\nMake it your reason for living\nGive all the love you can give him\nAll the love you can\n\nThere'll be times when he won't say a word\nAnd you wonder if it's something you said\nThe gentle touch of your hand\nTell him you understand\nFor the love of him\nMake it your reason for living\nGive all the love you can give him\nAll the love you can\nLittle things he forgets to do\nHave you told him today I love you\nWhen he reaches out be there\nShow him that someone cares\n\nHe's a man and a man has to try\nLet him run, let him fall, let him cry\nHis world won't fall apart\nIf you take him into your heart\n\nFor the love of him\nMake it your reason for living\nGive all the love you can give him\nAll the love you can\n\nFor the love of him\nMake it your reason for living\nGive all the love you can give him\nAll the love you can\n(fades)Embed"
