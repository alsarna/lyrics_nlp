    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPut your head on my shoulder\nHold me in your arms, baby\nSqueeze me oh so tight\nShow me that you love me too\n\n[Verse 2]\nPut your lips next to mine, dear\nWon't you kiss me once, baby\nJust a kiss goodnight, maybe\nYou and I will fall in love\n(You and I will fall in love)\n\n[Bridge]\nPeople say that love's a game\nA game you just can't win\nIf there's a way\nI'll find it someday\nAnd then this fool will rush in\n\n[Verse 3]\nPut your head on my shoulder\nWhisper in my ear, baby\nWords I want to hear\nTell me, tell me that you love me too\n(Tell me that you love me too)\n[Outro]\nPut your head on my shoulder\nWhisper in my ear, baby\nWords I want to hear, baby\nPut your head on my shoulder"
