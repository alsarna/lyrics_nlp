    "lyrics": "I beg your pardon momma\nWhat did you say?\nMy mind was drifted off on Martinique Bay\nIt's not that I'm not interested you see\nAugusta Georgia is just no place to be\nI think Jamaican in the moonlight\nSandy beaches drinkin' rum every night\nWe got no money momma but we can go\nWe'll split the difference go to Coconut Grove\nKeep on talkin' momma I can't hear\nYour voice it tickles down inside of my ear\nI feel a tropical vacation this year\nMight be the answer to this hillbilly beer\nI think Jamaican in the moonlight\nSandy beaches drinkin' rum every night\nWe got no money momma but we can go\nWe'll split the difference go to Coconut Grove\nVoila! An American Dream\nWell we can travel girl without any means\nWhen it's as easy as closin' your eyes\nAnd dream Jamaica is a big neon sign\nJust keep talkin' momma I like that sound\nIt goes so easy with that rain fallin' down\nI think a tropical vacation this year\nMight be the answer to this hillbilly beer, and\nVoila! An American Dream\nYeah we can travel girl without any means\nWhen it's as easy as closin' your eyes\nAnd dream Jamaica is a big neon sign\nJust think Jamaican in the moonlight\nSandy beaches drinkin' rum every night\nWe got no money momma but we can go\nSplit the difference go to Coconut Grove"
