    "lyrics": "You, I don't know what to say\nYou take my breath away\nYou're every song I sing\nYou're the music that I play\nAnd you take my breath away\n\nYou, you smile and it's okay\nYou take my breath away\nLike water from a spring on a sizzling summer day\nOh you take my breath away\n\nThere are words for the magic of a sunrise\nOnly none of them will do\nFor you, you take my breath away\nAnd I don't know what to say\n'Cause you take my breath away\n\nYou, you take my breath away\nAnd I don't know what to say\n'Cause you take my breath away\nYou take my breath away\nYou take my breath away\n\nYou take my breath away\nYou take my breath away\nOh yeah, you take my breath away\nOh, you take my breath away\nOh, I say you take my breath away, yeah yeah\nI say, I say, I say you take my breath away"
