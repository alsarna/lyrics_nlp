I'm at your feet\n\n[Chorus 1]\nWhenever, wherever\nWe're meant to be together\nI'll be there and you'll be near\nAnd that's the deal, my dear\nThereover, hereunder\nYou'll never have to wonder\nWe can always play by ear\nBut that's the deal, my dear\n[Verse 2]\nLucky that my lips not only mumble\nThey spill kisses like a fountain\nLucky that my breasts are small and humble\nSo you don't confuse them with mountains\nLucky I have strong legs like my mother\nTo run for cover when I need it\nAnd these two eyes that for no other\nThe day you leave will cry a river\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLe ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le\nAt your feet\nI'm at your feet\n\n[Chorus 1]\nWhenever, wherever\nWe're meant to be together\nI'll be there and you'll be near\nAnd that's the deal, my dear\nThereover, hereunder\nYou'll never have to wonder\nWe can always play by ear\nBut that's the deal, my dear\n\n[Bridge]\nLe ro le le lo le, le ro le le lo le\nThink out loud, say it again\nLe ro lo le lo le lo le\nTell me one more time\nThat you'll live\nLost in my eyes\n[Chorus 2]\nWhenever, wherever\nWe're meant to be together\nI'll be there and you'll be near\nAnd that's the deal, my dear\nThereover, hereunder\nYou've got me head over heels\nThere's nothing left to fear\nIf you really feel the way I feel\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWhenever, wherever\nWe're meant to be together\nI'll be there and you'll be near\nAnd that's the deal, my dear\nThereover, hereunder\nYou've got me head over heels\nThere's nothing left to fear\nIf you really feel the way I feel21Embed"
