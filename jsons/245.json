    "lyrics": "[00:00:00]\nOh shit, I guess we're starting\nThe mic is where my heart is\nI know what my part is\nI hear my own voice\nI make my own choice\nI guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's time to start the race\nShoutout to Kathy Bates and also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the maître d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat’d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my ‘lanta\nI can’t believe that he’s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I’m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI’m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it’s only two feet\nThat’s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that’s floatin' up in the air\nIt’s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you cannot do me\nDo me, do me like that\nI got that roomie type rap\nIt’s mad philosophical\nI just keep on droppin' all\nOf the marbles in my brain\nThey’re comin' out my nose\nAnd then they just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat’s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like “Watsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew”\nI'm like “Dude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le”\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that shit\nOh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it\nHe's just Frank Coppin it\nAnd there is no halting' it\nI just put some fuckin malt in it\nMake it like some Yoo-hoo\nYoo-hoo!\nDid you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear\nSee how I could sing, that took many years\nBefore I try to do with the din\nAnd now I only rapped\nAnd now I only try to cap, no cap\nI just try to get that back\nThat back, uh, back\nAnd I'm gone\nOver the fence\nNo shout out to my pens\n\nYou know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda\n\n[00:40:00]\nI'm sittin' on the veranda\nJust sippin' on my water\nLookin' at my ink blotter\nFeelin' like the best\nStarin' at my roar shark test\nAnd it's tellin' me some dark crap\nIt's tellin' some star type of stuff\nLike oh shit, I'm gruff\nI'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff\nScruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois\n6-0-6-5-2 that I'm\n(00:44:22)\nYou know that a bat kills\nUsing sonar\nGoing through the cave\nWith the lights pulsing like it is a rave\nI am not a knave\nIn the sense of my evil\nI'm like Evel Knievel\nI can jump over three mics\nWith my tiny little bike\nI am gettin' funky\nDid you see that video yesterday with the monkey\nOn the motorbike\nThat pulled that kid down the street, yeah that little tike\nIt was really scary\nI didn't eat for like three hours, you dared me\nTo, but I said that that video was too weird\nA monkey trying to steal a kid, man, this dude's clear-ly\nA weird type of simian\nType of chimpanzee, I don't know which one\nIt was, it was in Jakarta, I think?\nI don't know what type of the rink\nOf this world that I skate\nI repeat that I'm late\nTo the party\nBut that means that partly I gotta go hardy\nHardly, not like Tom Hardy\nI don't like smarties[?]\nThis is a smoothie by the

just imagine\nThat you were underground with an fat one\nI mean under the ocean rollin' up\nTryin' to light a blunt in the ocean\nI don't think that it would light, what emotion\nDo you think if you think of Spongebob\nRollin' up under the ground in a pineapple\nUnder the sea, that is quite snapple [?] of me\nTo tell you exactly, you see?\nI smell you, I feel you, E-40\nWould say that to me if it was not so portly\nIf he was not better\nOh shit, I accidentally insulted E-40\nAnd I was not on purpose\nLord, forgive me, I did not mean this to do this\nIt just came out of my mouth then it felt
