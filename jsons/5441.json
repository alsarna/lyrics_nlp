(No)\nBut you won't let me\nYou upset me, girl\nAnd then you kiss my lips\nAll of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)\nCan't remember what you did\nBut I hate it...\nYou know exactly what to do\nSo that I can't stay mad at you\nFor too long, that's wrong\nBut I hate it\nYou know exactly how to touch\nSo that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more\nSaid I despise that I adore you\n[Chorus: Rihanna & (Ne-Yo)]\nAnd I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)\nI can't stand how much I need you (I need you)\nAnd I hate how much I love you, boy (Oh, whoa)\nBut I just can't let you go\nAnd I hate that I love you so (Oh)\n\n[Verse 2: Ne-Yo & Rihanna]\nYou completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)\nThe only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)\nSaid it's not fair\nHow you take advantage of the fact\nThat I...
