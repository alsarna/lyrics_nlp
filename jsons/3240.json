How could I be so wrong?\nLeaving me all alone\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't you know the hurt will cause an inferno\nRomance up in flames, why should I take the blame?\nYou were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)\nApology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected\n\n[Chorus]\nOh...\nI gave you all of me (Gave me all of you)\nHow was I to know you would weaken so easily\nI...\nI don't know what to do\nNow I'm all cried out (I'm all)\nOver you (I'm cried out, too)\n\n[Chorus]\nI...\nI gave you my love in vain\nMy body never knew such pleasure\nMy heart never knew such pain\nAnd you...\n(I left you so confused\nNow I'm all cried out)\nNow I'm all cried out\nOver you"
