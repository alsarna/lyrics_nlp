You could have let me know\nSo now, I'm all alone\nGirl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance\nWith you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand\nOh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face\nWhy did you turn away?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSo why does your pride make you run and hide?\nAre you that afraid of me?\nBut I know it's a lie, what you keep inside\nThis is not how you want it to be\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, baby, I will wait for you\n'Cause I don't know what else I can do\nDon't tell me I ran out of time\nIf it takes the rest of my life\nBaby, I will wait for you\nIf you think I'm fine, it just ain't true\nI really need you in my life\nNo matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you\n[Verse 2]\nBeen a long time since you called me\n(How could you forget about me?)\nYou gotta be feeling crazy\nHow can you walk away? Everything stays the same\nI just can't do it, baby\nWhat will it take to make you come back?\nGirl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that\nWhy can't you look at me? You're still in love with me\nDon't leave me crying\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nBaby, why can't we just, just start over again\nGet it back to the way it was?\nIf you give me a chance, I can love you right\nBut you're telling me it won't be enough\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, baby, I will wait for you\n'Cause I don't know what else I can do\nDon't tell me I ran out of time\nIf it takes the rest of my life\nBaby, I will wait for you\nIf you think I'm fine, it just ain't true\nI really need you in my life\nNo matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSo why does your pride make you run and hide?\nAre you that afraid of me?\nBut I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside\nThis is not how you want it to be\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby, I will wait for you\nBaby, I will wait for you, if it's the last thing I do\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, I will wait for you\n'Cause I don't know what else I can do\nDon't tell me I ran out of time\nIf it takes the rest of my life\nBaby, I will wait for you\nIf you think I'm fine, it just ain't true\nI really need you in my life\nNo matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you\nI'll be waiting"
