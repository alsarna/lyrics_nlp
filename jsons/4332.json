(i didn't mind)\nI apologize (baby that's fine)\nI will wait forever just to know you were mine (ooh)\nYou know i love your hair ( sure it looks right?)\nI love what you wear (isnt it too tight?)\nYou're exceptionali can't wait for the rest of my life\nChorus\nOhh my life has just begun i've finally found someone\nAnd whatever i do..it's just got to be you\nOhh my life has just begun....\nI've finally found someone...........Embed"
