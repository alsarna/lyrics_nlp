I didn't mind\n(I apologize) Baby, that's fine\n(I would wait forever)\n((Just to know you were mine))\n(You know, I love your hair) Are you sure it looks right?\n(I love what you wear) Isn't it too tight?\n(You're exceptional)\n((I can't wait for the rest of my life))\n\n[Chorus]\n((This is it))\n((Ohhhhh, I finally found someone))\n((Someone to share my life))\n((I finally found the one))\n((To be with every night))\n'Cause whatever I do (It's just got to be you, Oh yeah)\n((My life has just begun, I finally found someone))\n\n[Outro]\nAnd whatever I do\n(It's just got to be you)\nOooh my life has just begun\n((I finally found someone))"
