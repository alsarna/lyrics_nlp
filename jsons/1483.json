    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis\nShe tried to take me upstairs for a ride\nShe had to heave me right across her shoulder\nCause I just can't seem to drink it off my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's the honky tonk women\nGimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues\n\n[Verse 2]\nI laid a divorcee in New York City\nI had to put up some kind of a fight\nThe lady then she covered me with roses\nShe blew my nose and then she blew my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's the honky tonk women\nGimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues\n\n[Verse 3]\nStrollin' on the boulevards of Paris\nNaked as the day that I will die\nThe sailors, they're so charming there in Paris\nBut I just don't seem to sail you off my mind\n[Chorus]\nIt's the honky tonk women\nGimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues"
