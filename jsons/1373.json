It's cause I'm short, I know\n\n[Verse 1]\nOh, I could hide 'neath the wings\nOf the bluebird as she sings\nThe six o'clock alarm would never ring\nBut it rings and I rise\nWipe the sleep out of my eyes\nMy shavin' razor's cold and it stings.\n\n[Chorus]\nCheer up, sleepy Jean\nOh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer\nAnd a homecoming queen\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou once thought of me\nAs a white knight on his steed\nNow you know how happy I can be\nOh, and our good times starts and end\nWithout dollar one to spend\nBut how much, baby, do we really need\n[Chorus]\nCheer up, sleepy Jean\nOh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer\nAnd a homecoming queen\n\n[Chorus]\nCheer up, sleepy Jean\nOh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer\nAnd a homecoming queen\n\n[Instrumental interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nCheer up, sleepy Jean\nOh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer\nAnd a homecoming queen\n\n[Chorus (Repeat and fade)]\nCheer up, sleepy Jean\nOh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer\nAnd a homecoming queen"
