(Hoo)\nAnd how much more must I take\nBefore loneliness\nWill cause my heart, heart to break?\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo, I can't bear\nTo live my life alone\nI've grown impatient for a love\nTo call my own\nBut when I feel that I\nI can't go on\nWell these precious words\nKeep me hangin' on\nI remember Mama said\n[Chorus]\n\"(You can't hurry love)\nNo, you'll just have to wait\"\nShe said, \"Love don't come easy\nBut it's a game of give and take\"\n“You can't hurry love (Hoo)\nNo, you'll just have to wait\nJust trust in a good time\nNo matter how long it takes”\nAnd now break!\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow love, love\nIt don't come easy\nBut I keep on waiting\nAnticipating\nFor that soft voice\nTo talk to me at night\nFor some tender arms\nHold me tight\n\n[Chorus]\nI keep waiting (Hoo)\nTill that day\nBut it ain't easy, no (Love don't come easy)\nYou know it ain't easy, my mama said\n“You can't hurry love\nNo, you'll just have to wait\nShe said, \"Love don't come easy\nBut it's a game of give and take\"\n“You can't hurry love (Hoo)\nNo, you'll just have to wait”\nShe said, \"Love don't come easy\nIt's a game of give and take\"\n“You can't hurry love\nNo, you'll just have to wait”5Embed"
