(too many nights!)\nToo many stars! (too many stars!)\nToo many moons could change your mind!\n(don't let the moon change your mind!)\n\nIf I'm gone too long\nDon't forget where you belong\nWhen the stars come out remember you are mine!\n\nDon't let the stars get in your eyes\nDon't let the moon break your heart!\nLove blooms at night\nIn daylight it dies\nDon't let the stars get in your eyes\nDon't keep your heart from me\nFor some day I'll return\nAnd you know you're the only one I'll ever love!\n(don't let the stars get in your eyes\nDon't let the moon break your heart! )\n\n(pa pa pa pia, pa pa pa pia)\nToo many miles! (too many miles!)\nToo many days! (too many days!)\nToo many nights to be alone! (too many nights all alone!)\nOh! please keep your heart, while we are apart\nDon't you linger in the moonlight when I'm gone! (while I'm gone!)\n\nDon't let the stars get in your eyes\nDon't let the moon break your heart!\n(Don't let the moon break your heart!)\nLove blooms at night\nIn daylight it dies\nDon't let the stars get in your eyes\nDon't keep your heart from me\nFor some day I'll return\nAnd you know you're the only one I'll ever love!\n(I'll ever love!) I'll ever love!\n\nYou're the only one! (you're the only one!)\nI'll ever love!"
