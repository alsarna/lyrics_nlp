    "lyrics": "Take the ribbon from my hair\nShake it loose and let it fall\nLay it soft upon my skin\nLike the shadows on the wall\n\nCome and lay down by my side\nTil the early mornin' light\nAll I'm takin' is your time\nHelp me make it through the night\n\nChorus:\nI don't care what's right or wrong\nI won't try to understand\nLet the devil take tomorrow\nBut tonight I need a friend\n\nYesterday is dead and gone\nAnd tomorrow's out of sight\nAnd it's sad to be alone\nHelp me make it through the night\n\n(Repeat Chorus)"
