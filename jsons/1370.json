(and sing it)\nI figure it's about the happiest sound goin' down today\n\nThe message may not move me\nOr mean a great deal to me\nBut hey! it feels so groovy to say:\nI dig the Mamas and the Papas at \"The Trip,\"\nSunset Strip in L.A\nAnd they got a good thing goin'\nWhen the words don't get in the way\nAnd when they're really wailing\nMichelle and Cass are sailin'\nHey! they really nail me to the wall\n\nI dig Donovan in a dream-like, tripped out way\nHis crystal images tell you 'bout a brighter day\nAnd when the Beatles tell you (Beatles tell you)\nThey've got a word \"love\" to sell you\nThey mean exactly what they say\n\nI dig Rock and Roll music\nI could really get it on in that scene\nI think I could say somethin' if you know what I mean\nBut if I really say it, the radio won't play it\nUnless I lay it between the lines"
