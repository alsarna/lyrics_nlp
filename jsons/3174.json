    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nUnder the ruins of a walled city\nCrumbling towers and beams of yellow light\nNo flags of truce, no cries of pity\nThe siege guns had been pounding all through the night\nIt took a day to build the city\nWe walked through its streets in the afternoon\nAs I returned across the fields I'd known\nI recognized the walls where I'd once laid\nI had to stop in my tracks for fear\nOf walking on the mines I'd laid\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd if I built this fortress around your heart\nEncircled you in trenches and barbed wire\nThen let me build a bridge\nFor I cannot fill the chasm\nAnd let me set the battlements on fire\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen I went off to fight some battle\nThat I'd invented inside my head\nAway so long for years and years\nYou probably thought or even wished that I was dead\nWhile the armies are all sleeping\nBeneath the tattered flag we'd made\nI had to stop in my track for fear\nOf walking on the mines I'd laid\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis prison has now become your home\nA sentence you seem prepared to pay\nIt took a day to build the city\nWe walked through its streets in the afternoon\nAs I returned across the lands I'd known\nI recognized the fields where I'd once played\nI had to stop in my tracks for fear\nOf walking on the mines I'd laid\n\n[Chorus]"
