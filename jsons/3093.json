('Member, 'member)\nIt's your favorite radio station\nIn your favorite radio city\nThe city by the bay, the city that rocks\nThe city that never sleeps\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMarconi plays the mamba\nListen to the radio, don't you remember?\nWe built this city\nWe built this city on rock and roll\n\n[Chorus]\nWe built this city\nWe built this city on rock and roll\nBuilt this city\nWe built this city on rock and roll\nBuilt this city (Oo-ho)\nWe built this city on rock and roll\nBuilt this city\nWe built this city on rock and roll\n\n[Outro]\nWe built, we built this city, yeah\n(Built this city) We built, we built this city\nWe built, we built this city, yeah\n(Built this city) We built, we built this city\nWe built, we built this city, yeah\n(Built this city) We built, we built this city\nWe built, we built this city, yeah\n(Built this city) We built, we built this city\nWe built, we built this city, yeah11Embed"
