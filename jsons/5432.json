No one\nThinking that I deserve it\nNow I realize that I really didn't know\nIf you didn't notice, you mean everything\nQuickly I'm learning to love again\nAll I know is I'ma be okay\n[Chorus]\nThought I couldn't live without you\nIt's gonna hurt when it heals too (oh, yeah)\nIt'll all get better in time\nAnd even though I really love you\nI'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to\nIt'll all get better in time\n\n[Verse 2]\nI couldn't turn on the TV\nWithout something there to remind me\nWas it all that easy\nTo just put aside your feelings?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh\nHurt my feelings, but that's the path\nI believe in, and I know that time will heal it\nIf you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything\nQuickly I'm learnin' to love again\nAll I know is I'ma be okay\n\n[Chorus]\nThought I couldn't live without you\nIt's gonna hurt when it heals, too (Oh, yeah)\nIt'll all get better in time\nAnd even though I really love you\nI'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to (Ooh)\nIt'll all get better in time\n[Bridge]\nSince there's no more you and me (no more you and me)\nIt's time I let you go so I can be free\nAnd live my life how it should be (and I know, and I know)\nNo matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you (Yes, I will!)\n\n[Chorus]\nThought I couldn't live without you\nIt's gonna hurt when it heals, too\nIt'll all get better in time\nAnd even though I really loved you\nI'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to, yes I do\nIt'll all get better in time\nThought I couldn't live without you\nIt's gonna hurt when it heals, too (yeah)\nIt'll all get better in time\nAnd even though I really loved you\nGonna smile 'cause I deserve to10Embed"
