    "lyrics": "Now the hacienda's dark\nThe town is sleeping\nNow the time has come to part\nThe time for weeping\n\nVaya con Dios, my darling\nVaya con Dios, my love\n\nNow the village mission bells\nAre softly ringing\nIf you listen with your heart\nYou'll hear them singing\n\nVaya con Dios, my darling\nVaya con Dios, my love\n\nWherever you may be, I'll be beside you\nAlthough you're many million dreams away\nEach night I'll say a prayer\nA prayer to guide you\nTo hasten every lonely hour of every lonely day\n\nNow the dawn is breaking through\nA gray tomorrow\nBut the memories we share\nAre there to borrow\nVaya con Dios, my darling\nVaya con Dios, my love\n\nVaya con Dios, my darling\nVaya con Dios, my love"
