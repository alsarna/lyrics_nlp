    "lyrics": "Day after day alone on the hill\nThe man with the foolish grin\nIs keeping perfectly still\nBut nobody wants to know him\nThey can see that he's just a fool\nAnd he never gives an answer\nBut the fool on the hill\nSees the sun going down\nAnd the eyes in his head\nSee the world spinning around\n\nWell on his way his head in a cloud\nThe man of a thousand voices\nTalking percetly loud\nBut nobody ever hears him\nOr the sound he appears to make\nAnd he never seems to notice\nBut the fool on the hill\nNobody seems to like him\nThey can tell what he wants to do\nAnd he never shows his feelings\nBut the fool on the hill"
