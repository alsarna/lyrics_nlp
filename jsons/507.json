    "lyrics": "When you left me all alone\nAt the record hop\nTold me you were going out\nFor a soda pop\nYou were gone for quite awhile\nHalf an hour or more\nYou came back\nAnd man, oh man\nThis is what I saw\n\nChorus\nLipstick on your collar\nTold a tale on you\nLipstick on your collar\nSaid you were untrue\nBet your bottom dollar\nYou and I are through\nCause lipstick on your collar\nTold a tale on you, yeah\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\nYou said it belonged to me\nMade me stop and think\nAnd then I noticed yours was red\nMine was baby pink\nWho walked in but Mary Jane\nLipstick all a mess\nWere you smoochin' my best friend?\nGuess the answer's yes\nRepeat Chorus\n\nCause lipstick on your collar\nTold a tale on you, boy\nTold a tale on you, man\nTold a tale on you, yeah"
