Uh huh\nBrown sugar, just like a young girl should, uh huh, oh (Woo)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDrums beating, cold English blood runs hot\nLady of the house wonderin' when it's gonna stop\nHouse boy knows that he's doing alright\nYou shoulda heard 'em just around midnight\n\n[Chorus]\nBrown sugar, how come you taste so good now?\nBrown sugar, just like a young girl should now (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nAh, get on, brown sugar, how come you taste so good?\nAh, got me craving the, the brown sugar\nJust like a black girl should, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nAh, and I bet your mama was a tent show queen\nAnd all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen\nI'm no schoolboy, but I know what I like\nYou shoulda heard me just around midnight\n[Chorus]\nBrown sugar, how come you taste so good, baby?\nAh, come down, brown sugar\nJust like a young girl should, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nI said, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo\nHow come you, how come you taste so good?\nYeah, yeah, yeah, woo\nJust like a, just like a black girl should\nYeah, yeah, yeah, woo"
