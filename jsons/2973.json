    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've got a feeling we could be serious, girl\nRight at this moment, I could promise you the world\nBefore we go crazy, before we explode\nThere's something about me, baby, you got to know\nYou got to know\n\n[Chorus]\nI get off on '57 Chevys\nI get off on screaming guitar\nLike the way it gets me every time it hits me\nI've got a rock 'n' roll, I've got a rock 'n' roll heart\n\n[Verse 2]\nFeels like we're falling into the arms of the night\nSo if you're not ready, don't be holding me so tight\nI guess there's nothing left for me to explain\nHere's what you're getting and I don't want to change\nI don't want to change\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't need to glitter, no Hollywood\nAll you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro: repeat until fade]\nI've got a, you've got a rock 'n' roll heart..."
