Who cares about\nLittle boys that talk too much?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI've seen it all go down\nThe game of love was all rained out\nSo come on, baby, come on over\nLet me be the one to hold you\n[Chorus]\nI'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one, yeah)\nDeep inside I hope you'll feel it too (feel it too)\nWaited on a line of greens and blues (waited on a line, yeah)\nJust to be the next to be with you\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy be alone when we can be together, baby?\nYou can make my life worth while\nI can make you start to smile\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nWhen it's through, it's through\nAnd fate will twist the both of you\nSo come on, baby, come on over\nLet me be the one to show you\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)\nDeep inside I hope you'll feel it too (feel it too)\nWaited on a line of greens and blues (waited on a line, yeah)\nJust to be the next to be with you\n\n[Coda]\nI'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)\nDeep inside I hope you'll feel it too (deep inside, you feel it too)\nWaited on a line of greens and blues (waited on that line, yeah)\nJust to be the next to be with you\nJust to be the next to be with you, ooh"
