    "lyrics": "Tuff LyricsWhen you say it's dead and gone, yes, I know you're wrong\nCut and slash, sharpest knife, it won't die\nPoison cup, drank it up, it won't die\nNo fire, no gun, no rope, no stone, it won't die\nWhy you gotta shove it in my face?\nAs if you put me in my place\n'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right\nAin't gonna spend another night in your bed, in your bed\nLaws of man, are just pretend, they ain't mine\nLove so good, love so bad, it won't die\nSome talk too long, they know it all, I just smile and move on\nWords ain't free like you and me, I don't mind\nWhy'd you have to be so mean and cruel?\nThe dogs are loose I'm on to you\nYou ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk\nCan't call it leavin', 'cause it's just, I never came\nI never came, I never came, I never came\nI never came, I never came, I never cameEmbed"
