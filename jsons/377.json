    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI will spend my whole life through\nLoving you, just loving you\nWinter, summer, springtime, too\nLoving you, loving you\n\nMakes no difference where I go or what I do\nYou know that I'll always be loving you\nJust you and\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I'm seen with someone new\nDon't be blue, don't you be blue\nI'll be faithful, I'll be true\nAlways true, true to you\n\nThere is only one for me and you know who\nYou know that I'll always be loving you"
