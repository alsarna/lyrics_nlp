I should've never come to this\nSo holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done\nI'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'\nAnd I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way\nSo tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready\nAnd I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low\nYo, I'll be over here\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nOh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nAnd I can't wait till we can break up out of here404Embed"
