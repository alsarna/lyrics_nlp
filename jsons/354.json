    "lyrics": "Around The World LyricsAround the world I’ve searched for you;\nI traveled on when hope was gone\nTo keep a rendezvous\nI knew somewhere, sometime, somehow\nYou’d look at me and I would see\nThe smile you’re smil-ing now\nIt might have been in country down\nOr in new York, or gay Paree\nOr even London town\nNo more will I go all around the world\nFor I have found my world in youEmbed"
