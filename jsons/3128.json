Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\nI'm missing you\nTell me why the road turns\nOooh, oooh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\nI'm missing you\nTell me why the road turns\nOh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\nAs I look around, I see things that remind me\nJust to see you smile made my heart filled with joy\nI still recall all those dreams we shared together\nWhere did you run to, boy?\n\nOooh, oooh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\nI'm missing you\nTell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)\nOooh, oooh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\nI'm missing you\nTell me why the road turns\n\nSometimes I wondered, I didn't understand\nJust where were you trying to go\nOnly you knew the plan\nAnd I tried to be there, but you wouldn't let me in\nBut now you've gone away, boy\n\nI feel so brokenhearted.  (Oh.)\nI knew the day we started that we were meant to be\nIf only you'd let me\nI've cried so many tears.  (Oh.)\nGotta face now all my fears.  (Oh, oh.)\nWe let time slip away\nI need you, boy, here again\nThere was so much you gave me to my heart, to my soul\nThere was so much of your dreams that were never told\nYou had so much hope for a brighter day\nWhy were you my flower plucked away?\n\n(Oooh, oooh.  I'm missing you.)\nTell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)\nOooh, oooh\nOooh, oooh.  I'm missing you\nTell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)\nTell me, tell me why.  (Oooh, oooh.  I'm missing you.)\nTell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)\nOh.  Don't understand it.  (Oooh, oooh, I'm missing you.)\nOh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  (Tell me why the road turns.)\nOooh, oooh.  I'm missing you\nTell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)4Embed"
