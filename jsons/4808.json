(Oh, no)\nMe and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?\nYou scream I'm in the streets all night\nOr where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)\nI'm slow caught\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]\nI used to say I couldn't do it but I did it\nAfter telling everybody that I wasn't with it\nThough it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it\nAnd I know inside I'ma be alright\nI said I couldn't do it but I did it\nAfter telling everybody that I wasn't with it\nThough it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it\nAnd that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright3Embed"
