    "lyrics": "Oooh, babe\nAin't nothing like the real thing, baby\nAin't nothing like the real thing.  No, no\nAin't nothing like the real thing, baby\nAin't nothing like the real thing\nOh, honey\n\nI got your picture hanging on the wall\nBut it can see or come to me when I call your name\nI realized it's just a picture in a frame\nOooh, I read your letters when you're not here\nBut they don't move me and they don't groove me\nLike when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear\nDon't you know?\n\nAin't nothing like the real thing, baby\nAin't nothing like the real thing\n\nI play my game of fantasy\nI pretend, but I know in reality\nI need the shelter of your arms to comfort me\n\nNo other sound is quite the same as your name\nNo touch can do half as much to make me feel better\nSo let's stay together.  (Oh, oooh.)\nI got some memories to look back on\nAnd though they help me when you're gone\nI'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there\nOh\nSo glad we got the real thing, baby\nSo glad we got the real thing\nOh, Marvin.  (I know, honey.)\nAin't nothing like the real thing, baby.  (So glad, so glad.)\n(Oh, baby.) Ain't nothing like the real thing\nTalk to me\nAin't nothing like the real thing, baby.  (Oooh.)\n(Oh, I'm so glad.) Ain't nothing like the real thing"
