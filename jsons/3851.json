Is this some sort of hip music that I don't understand?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI hate the rain and sunny weather\nAnd I, I hate the beach and mountains too, boo-hoo\nAnd I don't like a thing about the city, no, no\nAnd I, I, I, hate the countryside too!\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I, hate everything about you\nEverything about you\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I don't like a thing about your mother\nAnd I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo-hoo\nAnd I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no\nCause I, I, I think sex is overrated too\n[Chorus]\nAnd I get sick when I'm around\nI can't stand to be around\nI hate everything about you\nEverything about you\nEverything about you\nEverything about you\n\n[Bridge]\nSome say I've got a bad attitude\nBut that don't change the way I feel about you\nAnd if you think this might be bringing me down\nLook again cause I ain't wearing no frown\n\nWell, I don't really care about your sister\nForget the little bitch, cause I already kissed her\nOne thing that I did to your lady\nI put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe\n\nI know you know everybody knows\nThe way it comes, the way it's gonna go\nYou think it's sad\nWell that's too bad\nCause I'm havin'\nA ball hatin'\nEvery little thing about you! ha-ha!\n[Chorus]\nEverything about you, everything about\nI get sick when I'm around\nI can't stand to be around\n\n[Pre-Outro]\nI hate everything abou-u-u-ut\n\nYou!\n\n[Outro]1Embed"
