    "lyrics": "All Night Long LyricsWe get up early and we work all day\nWe put our time in cause we like to stay up\nAll night long\nAll night long\n\nWe keep on grinnin' 'til the weekend comes\nJust a pinch between your cheek and gums\nAll night long\nAll night long\n\nStart in the morning and get the job done\nTake care of business and we have some fun\nAll night long\nAll night long\n\nWe like a long neck and a good old song\nTurn it up and then we'll sing along\nSing along\nOh, we're stayin' up all night long\nAll night long\nAll night long\nAll night long\nAll night long\n\nSongwriter:  Joe Walsh3Embed"
