Lyrics[Verse 1:]\nGive me time to care\nThe moment's here for us to share\nStill my heart\nIs not always there\nWhat more can I say to you?\n\nCould I lie to you?\nI'm just too weak to face the truth\nNow I know\nI should make a move\nWhat more can I say?\n\n[Chorus:]\nHow can I fall?\nHow can I fall?\nWhen you just won't give me reasons\nWhen you just won't\nGive me reasons at all\n[Verse 2:]\nWhen all faith is gone\nI fight myself to carry on\nYet, I know of the harm I do\nWhat more can I say to you?\n\nNow I hold this line\nI know the choice to leave is mine\nI can't help\nWhat I feel inside\nWhat more can I say?\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Bridge:]\nI'll follow through\nI'll see I do\nWhen the time is far more\nRight for you\n\nI'll make that move\nAnd when I do\nWill I doubt again the way I do?\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\nHow can I fall?\nHow can I fall?\n(How can I fall?)\nWhen you just won't give me reasons\nWhen you just won't give me reasons at all\n[Repeat x2:]\nHow can I fall?\nHow can I fall?\n(How can I fall?)\nWhen you just won't give me reasons\nWhen you just won't give me reasons\n\nJust won't give me reasons\nJust won't give me reasons at all\nHow can I fall?\nI fall, I fall\nHow can I fall for you?\n\nHow can I fall?\nHow can I fall?\n(How can I fall?)\nWhen you just won't give me reasons\nWhen you just won't give me reasonsEmbed"
