    "lyrics": "Is everything all right?\nI just called to say how lost I feel without you\nMiles away\nI really can't believe I'm here and how I still care about you\n\nHearts can break\nAnd never mend together\nLove can fade away\nHearts can cry\nWhen love won't stay forever\nHearts can be that way\n\nIs everything the same?\nDo you ever think of me and how we loved one another?\nWill you change your mind?\nWill you want me back again or have you found yourself a new lover?\n\nHearts can break\nAnd never mend together\nLove can fade away\nHearts can cry\nWhen love won't stay forever\nHearts can be that way\n\nIs everything okay?\nI just thought I'd write a song to tell the world how I miss you\n'Cause each and every day\nI think of all the words I never said and all the chances that I had to\nHearts can break\nAnd never mend together\nLove can fade away\nHearts can cry\nWhen love won't stay forever\nHearts can be that way\nHearts can be that way\nHearts can be\n\nIs everything all right?"
