    "lyrics": "Last night I took a walk after dark\nA swingin' place called Palisades Park\nTo have some fun and see what I could see\nThat's where the girls are\n\nI took a ride on a shoot-the-chute\nThat girl I sat beside was awful cute\nAfter we stopped she was holdin' hands with me\nMy heart was flyin'\n\nUp like a rocket ship\nDown like a roller coaster\nBack like a loop-the-loop\nAnd around like a merry-go-round\n\nWe ate and ate at a hot dog stand\nWe danced around to a rockin' band\nAnd when I could I gave that girl a hug\nIn the tunnel of love\n\nYou'll never know how great a kiss can feel\nWhen you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel\nWhen I fell in love\nDown at Palisades Park\n\nWe ate and ate at a hot dog stand\nWe danced around to a rockin' band\nAnd when I could I gave that girl a hug\nIn the tunnel of love\nYou'll never know how great a kiss can feel\nWhen you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel\nWhen I fell in love\nDown at Palisades Park\n\nDown at Palisades Park\nYou know it's Palisades Park\nDown at Palisades Park"
