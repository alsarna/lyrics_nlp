    "lyrics": "They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway\nThey say there's always magic in the air\nBut when you're walking down that street\nAnd you ain't had enough to eat\nThe glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere\n\nThey say the women treat you right on Broadway\nBut looking at them just gives me the blues\n'Cause how you gonna make some time\nWhen all you got is one thin dime\nAnd one thin dime won't even shine your shoes\n\nThey say I won't last too long on Broadway\nI'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say\nBut they're dead wrong, I know they are\n'Cause I can play this guitar\nAnd I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway\n\nI won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway\nNo, no, no, no\nI won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway\n\nDo do do do"
