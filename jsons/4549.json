    "lyrics": "I will remember you\nWill you remember me?\nDon't let your life pass you by\nWeep not for the memories\n\nRemember the good times that we had?\nI let them slip away from us when things got bad\nHow clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun\nWanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one\n\nI will remember you\nWill you remember me?\nDon't let your life pass you by\nWeep not for the memories\n\nI'm so tired, but I can't sleep\nStandin' on the edge of something much too deep\nIt's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word\nWe are screaming inside, but we can't be heard\n\nBut I will remember you\nWill you remember me?\nDon't let your life pass you by\nWeep not for the memories\n\nI'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose\nClinging to a past that doesn't let me choose\nOnce there was a darkness, deep and endless night\nYou gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light\nAnd I will remember you\nWill you remember me?\nDon't let your life pass you by\nWeep not for the memories\n\nAnd I will remember you\nWill you remember me?\nDon't let your life pass you by\nWeep not for the memories\nWeep not for the memories"
