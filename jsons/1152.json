    "lyrics": "Go away from my window\nLeave at your own chosen speed\nI'm not the one you want, babe\nI'm not the one you need\n\nYou say you're lookin' for someone\nWho's never weak but always strong\nTo protect you and defend you\nWhether you are right or wrong\nSomeone to open each and every door\n\nBut it ain't me, babe\nA-no, no, no it ain't me, babe\nWell it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe\n\nGo lightly from the ledge, babe\nGo lightly on the ground\nI'm not the one you want, babe\nI'll only lead you down\n\nYou say you're lookin' for someone\nWho'll promise never to part\nSomeone to close his eyes to you\nSomeone to close his heart\nSomeone who will die for you and more\nBut it ain't me, babe\nA-no, no, no it ain't me, babe\nWell it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe\nNo it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe\n\nI said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe\nI said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe\nI said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe\nI said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe\nI said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe"
