    "lyrics": "You won't forget my eyes\nOoh deep inside you realize\nYou're gonna see me wherever you go\nYou're gonna hear me on your radio\nThere you are in your car\nAnd suddenly\nYou hear me\n\"Do you want me\nDo you want me\"\n\nTake me to heart\nI promise you a miracle\nTake me to heart\nYou're gonna be mine\nTake me to heart\nYou know it's just a matter of time\n\nI'm always on your mind\nI'm the chill that never left your spine\nIn the building where you live and breathe\nI'm the sound that never lets you sleep\nDown the hall through the walls\nYou hear a voice that's calling\n\"Do you want me\nDo you want me\"\nTake me to heart\nDon't deny the miracle\nTake me to heart\nWhat more can I say\nTake me to heart\nSurrender's just a motion away\n(Repeat)"
