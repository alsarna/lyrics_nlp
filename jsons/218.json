    "lyrics": "You're more than life to me\nMore than eternity . . \nAnd the more I know of you\nAll the more I love you . . \n\nI need you more each day\nMuch more than words can say. . \nMore than forevermore\nI'll be yours. . \n\nThe silver moon will fade too soon\nAnd bring the dawn when you'll be gone . . \nBefore you go, please let me know\nThat what you feel is really real . . \n\nSo do not grieve that I must leave\nBecause I live only for\nYour love an' mine\nMore and more!\n\n( repeat first two verses )\nMore than forevermore\nI'll be yours!"
