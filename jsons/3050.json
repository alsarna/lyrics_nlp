    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nYou've been around\nFor such a long time now\nOh, maybe I could leave you\nBut I don't know how\n\nAnd why should I be lonely every night\nWhen I can be with you\nOh, yes\nYou make it right\n\n[Chorus:]\nAnd I don't listen to the guys who say\nThat you're bad for me\nAnd I should turn you away\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI get a feeling when I look at you\nWherever you go now\nI wanna be there too\n\nThey say we're crazy\nBut I just don't care\nAnd if they keep on talking\nStill they get nowhere\n[Chorus:]\nSo I don't mind if they don't understand\nWhen I look at you when you hold my hand\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n\n[Bridge:]\nWhy should it matter to us\nIf they don't approve\nWe should just take our chances\nWhile we've got nothing to lose\nBaby\n\n[Verse 3:]\nThere's no need for living in the past\nNow I've found good loving\nGonna make it last\n\nI tell the others\nDon't bother me\nCause when they look at you\nThey don't see what I see\n\n[Repeat Chorus x3:]\nNo, I don't listen to their wasted lines\nGot my eyes wide open\nAnd I see the signs\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love"
