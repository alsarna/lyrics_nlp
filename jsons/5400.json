Mmm\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose\nWherever it goes, I always know\nThat you make me smile, please stay for a while now\nJust take your time, wherever you go\n\n[Breakdown]\nTa-da-dam, ta-da, da-dam, ta-da-dam, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-dam\nUm-ba, da-da, um-ba, ta-da-da-da, uhm, mm-mmh\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've been asleep for a while now\nYou tuck me in, just like a child now\n'Cause every time you hold me in your arms\nI'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth\n\n[Chorus]\nIt starts in my soul and I lose all control\nWhen you kiss my nose, the feeling shows\n'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now\nHolding me tight\n[Outro]\nWherever, wherever, wherever you go\nWherever, wherever, wherever you go\nWherever you go, I always know\n'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while"
