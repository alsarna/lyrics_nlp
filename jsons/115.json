    "lyrics": "Your cheating will make you weep\nYou'll cry and cry and try to sleep\nBut sleep won't come the whole night through\nYour cheating heart will tell on you\n\nWhen tears come down like falling rain\nYou'll toss around and call my name\nYou'll walk the floor the way I do\nYour cheating heart will tell on you\n\nWhen tears come down like falling rain\nYou'll toss around and call my name\nYou'll walk the floor the way I do\nYour cheating heart will tell on you"
