    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nJust a song before I go\nTo whom it may concern\nTraveling twice the speed of sound\nIt's easy to get burned\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen the shows were over\nWe had to get back home\nAnd when we opened up the door\nI had to be alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe helped me with my suitcase\nShe stands before my eyes\nDriving me to the airport\nAnd to the friendly skies\n\n[Verse 3]\nGoing through security\nI held her for so long\nShe finally looked at me in love\nAnd she was gone\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Outro]\nJust a song before I go\nA lesson to be learned\nTraveling twice the speed of sound\nIt's easy to get burned"
