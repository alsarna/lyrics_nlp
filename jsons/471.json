    "lyrics": "To save my soul I can't get a date\nBaby's got it tuned on channel eight\nNow Wyatt Earp and the Big Cheyenne\nThey're comin' through the T.V. shootin up the land\nAh...um...my baby loves the Western movies\nMy baby loves the Western movies\nBam, bam, shoot 'em up Pow\nAh..um..My babe loves the Western Movies\nI call my baby on the telephone\nTo tell her half my head was gone\nI just got hit by a great big brick\nShe says thanks for reminding me it's time for Maverick\nAh..um...my baby loves the Western movies\nMy baby loves the Western movies\nBam, bam, shoot em up pow\nAh...um...\nMy baby loves the Western movies\nWell there's Jeremy Roller and Old Cochise\nJim Hardy, Jim Bowie and Sugarfoot\nThey all have gun will travel\nGive me back my boots and saddle uh huh\nHere's the story of the certain Wagon Train Mccord\nA broken arrow has broken my heart\nA Jefferson Drum with his Restless Gun\nHog-tied my baby and the fight was won\nAh..um...my baby loves the Western movies\nMy baby loves the western movies\nBam bam shoot em up pow\nAh um, my baby loves the western movies"
