    "lyrics": "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Donâ€™t Want to Be Right LyricsIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right\nIf being right means being without you\nI'd rather live a wrong doing life\nYour mama and daddy say it's a shame\nIt's a downright disgrace\nLong as I got you by my side\nI don't care what your people say\nYour friends tell you it's no future\nIn loving a married man\nIf I can't see you when I want to\nI'll see you when I can\n\nIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right\nIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right\n\nAm I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you\nKnowing I got a wife and two little children\nDepending on me too\nAnd am I wrong to hunger\nFor the gentleness of your touch\nKnowing I got somebody else at home\nWho needs me just as much\nAnd are you wrong to fall in love\nWith a married man\nAnd am I wrong trying to hold on\nTo the best thing I ever had\nIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right\nIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right\n\n*sick horn break down*\n\nAre you wrong to give your love\nTo a married man\nAnd am I wrong trying to hold on\nTo the best thing I ever had\n\nIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right\nIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right\n\nI don't wanna be right\nIf it means being without you\nI don't wanna be right\nIf it means sleeping at night\nI don't wanna be right\nIf loving you is wrongEmbed"
