    "lyrics": "It Was I LyricsYou're tellin' everybody I'm the one\nTo blame for all the wrong that you have done\nThe day that you walked out and left, didn't say goodbye\nWho was home alone to sit and cry?\nIt was I, it was I-I-I-I-I\n\nI gave you all the love I ever had\nThe only things I got from you were bad\nThe times you didn't show up, the times you didn't call\nWho was left alone through it all?\nIt was I, it was I-I-I-I-I\n\nMy love was always yours to treasure and to hold\nBut when you let a love grow idle it will soon grow cold\nTemptation is too strong to hide, are you really satisfied\nWith my love the way it is? Let me tell you how it is\nPlease come back and try to start anew\nI know that it's the proper thing to do\nDarling, if we make up I know we'll never break up\nThen I know it's only me and you\nMe and youEmbed"
