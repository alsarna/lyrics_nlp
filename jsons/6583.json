Maybe\nBut look at where I ended up\nI'm all good already\nSo moved on, it's scary\nI'm not where you left me at all, so\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody\nIf you wanna believe that anything could stop me\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't show up, don't come out\nDon't start caring about me now\nWalk away, you know how\nDon't start caring about me now\n\n[Verse 2]\nAren't you the guy who tried to\nHurt me with the word \"goodbye\"?\nThough it took some time to survive you\nI'm better on the other side\nI'm all good already\nSo moved on, it's scary\nI'm not where you left me at all, so\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody\nIf you wanna believe that anything could stop me\n(Don't, don't, don't)\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't show up, don't come out\nDon't start caring about me now\nWalk away, you know how\nDon't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)\n\n[Bridge]\nUp, up\nDon't come out, out, out\nDon't show up, up, up\nDon't start now (Oh)\nUp, up\nDon't come out, out\nI'm not where you left me at all, so\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody\nIf you wanna believe that anything could stop me\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)\nDon't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)\nWalk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)\nDon't start caring about me now (So)\n[Outro]\nUp, up\nDon't come out, out, out\nDon't show up, up, up\nWalk away, walk away (So)\nUp, up\nDon't come out, out, out\nDon't show up, up, up\nWalk away, walk away, oh"
