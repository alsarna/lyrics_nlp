I'll change that scene one day\nToday I might be mad, tomorrow I'll be glad\nCause I'll have Friday on my mind\n\nGonna have fun in the city\nBe with my girl, she's so pretty\nShe looks fine tonight\nShe is out of sight to me\nTonight I'll spend my bread, tonight\nI'll lose my head, tonight\nI've got to get to night\nMonday I'll have Friday on my mind\n\nGonna have fun in the city\nBe with my girl, she's so pretty\nI'm gonna have fun in the city\nBe with my girl, she's so pretty2Embed"
