    "lyrics": "Hello again, hello\nJust called to say hello\nI couldn't sleep at all tonight\nAnd I know it's late\nBut I couldn't wait\n\nHello, my friend, hello\nJust called to let you know\nI think about you ev'ry night\nWhen I'm here alone\nAnd you're there at home, hello\n\nMaybe it's been crazy\nAnd maybe I'm to blame\nBut I put my heart above my head\nWe've been through it all\nAnd you loved me just the same\nAnd when you're not there\nI just need to hear\n\nHello, my friend, hello\nIt's good to need you so\nIt's good to love you like I do\nAnd to feel this way\nWhen I hear you say, hello\nHello, my friend, hello\nJust called to let you know\nI think about you ev'ry night\nAnd I know it's late\nBut I couldn't wait\nHello"
