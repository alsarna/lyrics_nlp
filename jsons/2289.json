    "lyrics": "There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind\nEven though she knows how much it's gonna hurt\nBefore I say another word let me tell you, I love you\nLet me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can\n\nThere's been another man that I've needed and I've loved\nBut that doesn't mean I love you less\nAnd he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will\nThere's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill\n\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' you both is breakin' all the rules\n\nYou mustn't think you've failed me\nJust because there's someone else\nYou were the first real love I ever had\nAnd all the things I ever said\nI swear they still are true\nFor no one else can have the part of me I gave to you\n\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' you both is breakin' all the rules\nI couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away\nBut with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay\n\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules\nTorn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool\nLovin' you both is breakin' all the rules\n\nTorn between two lovers\n\nFeelin' like a fool\nLovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules"
