    "lyrics": "Bottle of wine\nFruit of the vine\nWhen you gonna let me get sober?\nLeave me alone\nLet me go home\nLet me go home and start over\n\nRamblin' around this dirty old town\nSingin' for nickles and dimes\nTimes gettin' rough\nI ain't got enough\nTo buy me a bottle of wine\n\nBottle of wine\nFruit of the vine\nWhen you gonna let me get sober?\nLeave me alone\nLet me go home\nLet me go home and start over\n\nA pain in my head\nThere's bugs in my bed\nMy pants are so old that they shine\nOut on the street\nI beg the people I meet\nTo buy me a bottle of wine\n3X\nBottle of wine\nFruit of the vine\nWhen you gonna let me get sober?\nLeave me alone\nLet me go home\nLet me go home and start over\n\nLet me go home and start over\nLet me go home and start over"
