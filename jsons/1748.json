    "lyrics": "I won't ever leave\nIf you want me to stay\nNothing you could do\nThat could turn me away\n\nHanging on anyway\nBelieving the things you say\nBeing the fool\n\nYou've taken my life\nSo take my soul\nThat's what you said\nAnd I believed it all\n\nI want to be with you\nLong as you want me to\nBut don't move away\n\nAin't that what you said?\nAin't that what you said?\nAin't that what you said?\n\nLiar\nLiar, liar\n\nWe have seen no night\nWe have seen no day\nIf I ever leave\nWould you want me to stay?\nYou can believe in me\nI won't be leaving\nI won't let you go\n\nAin't that what you said?\nAin't that what you said?\nAin't that what you said?\n\nLiar\nLiar, liar\nLiar\n\nYou've taken my life\nSo take my soul\nThat's what you said\nBut who are we to know?\n\nI want to be with you\nLong as you want me to\nBut don't move away\n\nAin't that what you said?\nAin't that what you said?\nAin't that what you said?\n\nLiar\nLiar, liar"
