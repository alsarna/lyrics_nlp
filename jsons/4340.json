Just clap your hands, just clap your hands...)\nTo the L, to the Y and the T to the E\nSo get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me\n(Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house)\n\n[Hook]\nNow I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance\nI rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance\nI be the shit and it's all good and if you understood\n\n[Verse 1]\nWould you stop scheming and trying to look hard\nI get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred\nI'm a veteran, which means that I've been\nIn the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin\nWay back when I've been putting it down\nAsk your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town\nI flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee\nSpectacular over M-I-C\nI go for broke, never giving it less than the best\nLots of years in the game at your request\nYou like the rhyme, bite if you dare\nI get the paper so I don't care\nFly that's me; the epitomy\nOf what a real MC is supposed to be\nFucking you up every time that I drop\nI fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot\nI guide the beat and I ride it well\nAnd if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting\nIt's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none\nCause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down\nJust Brooklyn is where I'm from\nBut I'm resting in Studio City for the fun\nIf you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)\nAnd don't wait for me to explain cause I won't\nYou see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)\nWest to East, see East to West\nReady or not I have arrived and I'm live\nShowing an MC how to survive\nCause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics\nI got many witnesses that can back this\nRuffnecks, from New York to L.A\nBeen down with me since Poor George\nIt's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to\nMake the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well\nAnd if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nGet out my shit, please let me be\nI don't see why, you KGB\nWhy you gotta be all up on me like that\nTrying to get over like a fat rat\nBut I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop\nAnd the shit don't stop\nIt goes on, on, on, on\nYou see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn\nAnd now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver\nChilling with\nA pina colada, kidada hooked me up\nWith Tommy now I got a lot of gear\nFrom everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)\nBut I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done\nAll on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you?\nYou better get down with your real crew\n'Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well\nAnd if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro]\nTo the L, to the Y, and the T, to the E\n(Rock the house and rock the house)"
