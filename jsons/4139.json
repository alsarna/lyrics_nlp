(blind)\nHave I been lost? (lost)\nHave I been wrong? (Have I been wrong?)\nHave I been wise? (Have I been wise?)\nHave I been strong?\nHave I been hypnotized, mesmerized\nBy what my eyes have found?\n(By what my eyes have found?)\nIn that great street carnival\n(Whoa, in that carnival)\nHave I been blind? (blind)\nHave I been lost? (lost)\n(Have I been)\nHave I been wrong? (Have I been wrong?)\nHave I been wise? (Have I been wise?)\nHave I been strong?\nHave I been hypnotized, mesmerized\nBy what my eyes have found?\n(By what my eyes have found?)\nIn that great street carnival\nIn that carnival"
