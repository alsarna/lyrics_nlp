    "lyrics": "Stand Tall LyricsNever been this blue\nNever knew the meaning of a heartache\nBut then again, I've never lost at love before\n\nSomewhere down the road\nMaybe all these years will find some meaning\nI just can't think about it now, or live 'em out anymore\n\nChorus\nStand Tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish\nYou're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride\nStand Tall, don't you fall. don't go do something you'll regret later\nYou're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride\n\nNever lasted so long\nOr through so much - or through so many\nI just can't believe I could throw it all away\nSometimes late at night\nWhen there's nothing here except my old piano\nI'd almost give my hands to make you see my way\n\nChorus\nStand Tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish\nYou're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride;\nYou got me down on my knees for ya, mama\nStand Tall, don't you fall. donn't go do something you'll regret later\nYou're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human prideEmbed"
