Love Story LyricsWhere do I begin\nTo tell the story of how great a love can be\nThe sweet love story that is older than the sea\nThe simple truth about the love she brings to me\nWhere do I start\n\nWith her first hello\nShe gave new meaning to this empty world of mine\nThere'd never be another love, another time\nShe came into my life and made the living fine\nShe fills my heart\n\nShe fills my heart with very special things\nWith angels' songs, with wild imaginings\nShe fills my soul with so much love\nThat anywhere I go, I'm never lonely\nWith her around, who could be lonely\nI reach for her hand-it's always there\nHow long does it last\nCan love be measured by the hours in a day\nI have no answers now but this much I can say\nI know I'll need her till the stars all burn away\nAnd she'll be there\n\nHow long does it last\nCan love be measured by the hours in a day\nI have no answers now but this much I can say\nI know I'll need her till the stars all burn away\nAnd she'll be thereEmbed"
