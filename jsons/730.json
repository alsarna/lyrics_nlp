    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen we kiss, my heart's on fire\nBurning with a strange desire\nAnd I know, each time I kiss you\nThat your heart's on fire too\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo, my darling, please surrender (surrender)\nAll your love so warm and tender (surrender)\nLet me hold you in my arms, dear\nWhile the moon shines bright above\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll the stars will tell the story\nOf our love and all its glory\nLet us take this night of magic\nAnd make it a night of love\n\n[Outro]\nWon't you please surrender to me (surrender)\nYour lips, your arms, your heart, dear (surrender)\nBe mine forever\nBe mine tonight"
