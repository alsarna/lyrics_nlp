    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWho can say where the road goes?\nWhere the day flows? Only time\nAnd who can say if your love grows\nAs your heart chose? Only time\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho can say why your heart sighs\nAs your love flies? Only time\nAnd who can say why your heart cries\nWhen your love lies? Only time\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nWho can say when the roads meet?\nThat love might be in your heart?\nAnd who can say when the day sleeps\nIf the night keeps all your heart?\nNight keeps all your heart\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWho can say if your love grows\nAs your heart chose? Only time\nAnd who can say where the road goes?\nWhere the day flows? Only time\n[Outro]\nWho knows? Only time\nWho knows? Only time"
