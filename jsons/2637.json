Ah....\nWe may be big or small or black or white , eternally\nAnd black and white is you and me in a special light\nWe may be young or old or in between ,but this much I know\nTogether we can learn to grow\nIn a world that's ever turning it's back on you\nIf you give it all away \nMake it mine ,ine , ine , ine , mine\nYou are desire , everything you need\nI give you right or wrong\nAnd you are the woman that I\nBase my whole existence on\nAnd when I get to you my\nDesire is glowing in your light\n\nThese are the golden years we get to live\nWe lead the way , tomorrow we can start today\nIn a special light\nLove could be good or bad or in between\nBut this much I learn\nBaby , you and I can learn\nIn a world that's rearranging it's reality\nIf you give it all away\nMake it mine , ine , ine , ine , mine\nYou are desire , everything you need\nI give you right or wrong\nAnd you are the woman that I\nBase my whole existence on\nAnd when I get to you my\nDesire is glowing in your light\nAh...\nAnd it's nice to light a fire\nWhen it's cold outside\nIf you give it all away\nMake it mine , ine , ine , ine , mine\nYou are desire , everything you need\nI give you right or wrong\nAnd you are the woman that I\nBase my whole existence on\nAnd when I get to you my\nDesire is glowing in your lightEmbed"
