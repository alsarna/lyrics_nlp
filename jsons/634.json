    "lyrics": "A million to one\nThat's what our folks think about this love of ours\nA million to one\nThey say that our love will fade like yesterday's flowers\n\nThey're betting everything that our love won't survive\nThey're hoping\n(Hoping)\nIn time we'll forget\nEach others' lies\n\nA million to one\nThey feel we're too young to know the meaning of love\nA million to one\nThat they've forgotten the dreams that we're dreaming of\n\nBut we'll forgive them because we love them\nAfter all is said and done\nDear one, in a million, a million to one\n\n(But we'll forgive them because we love them)\nAfter all is said and done\nDear one, in a million, a million to one"
