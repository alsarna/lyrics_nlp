    "lyrics": "I see your face cloud over like a little girl's\nAnd your eyes have lost their shine\nYou whisper something softly\nI'm not meant to hear\nBaby tell me what's on your mind\nI don't' care what people say\nAbout the two of us from different worlds\nI love you so much that it hurts inside\nAre you listening\nPlease listen to me girl\n\nCan't we try just a little bit harder\nCan't we give just a little bit more\nCan't we try to understand\nThat it's love we're fighting for\nCan't we try just a little more passion\nCan't we try just a little less pride\nI love you so much baby\nThat it tears me up inside\n\nI hear you on the telephone\nWith god knows who\nSpilling out your heart for free\nEveryone needs someone they can talk to\nGirls that someone should be me\nSo many times I've tried to tell you\nYou just turn away\nMy life is changing so fast now\nLeaves me lonely and afraid\nDon't be afraid, no\n\nCan't we try just a little bit harder\nCan't we give just a little bit more\nCan't we try to understand\nThat it's love we're fighting for\nCan't we try just a little more passion\nCan't we try just a little less pride\n\nI love you so much baby\nThat it tears me up inside\nDon't let our love fade away\nNo matter what people say\nI need you more and more each day\n\nCan't we try just a little bit harder\nCan't we give just a little bit more\nCan't we try just a little bit harder\nCan't we give just a little bit more\nCan't we try just a little more passion\nCan't we try just a little less pride\nLove you so much baby\nTears me up inside"
