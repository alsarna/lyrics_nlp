    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDreams: that's where I have to go\nTo see your beautiful face anymore\nI stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio\nHope, hope there's a conversation\nWe both admit we had it good\nBut until then it's alienation, I know\nThat much is understood\nAnd I realize\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you ask me how I'm doing\nI would say I'm doing just fine\nI would lie and say that you're not on my mind\n(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)\nBut I go out and I sit down at a table set for two\nAnd finally I'm forced to face the truth\nNo matter what I say, I'm not over you\nNot over you (not over you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDamn, damn girl you do it well\nAnd I thought you were innocent\nTook this heart and put it through hell\nBut still you're magnificent\nI, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me\nI turn around and I'm back in the game\nEven better than the old me (Old me)\nBut I'm not even close without you\n[Chorus]\nIf you ask me how I'm doing\nI would say I'm doing just fine\nI would lie and say that you're not on my mind\n(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)\nBut I go out and I sit down at a table set for two\nAnd finally I'm forced to face the truth\nNo matter what I say, I'm not over you\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd if I had the chance to renew\nYou know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do\nI could get back on the right track\nBut only if you'd be convinced\nSo until then...\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you ask me how I'm doing\nI would say I'm doing just fine\nI would lie and say that you're not on my mind\nBut I go out and I sit down at a table set for two\nAnd finally I'm forced to face the truth\nNo matter what I say, I'm not over you\n\n[Outro]\nNot over you (Not over you)\nNot over you (Not over you)\nNot over you (Not over you)"
