She giving head for some red-bottoms\nCouple weeks later man that bitch got 'em\n\n[Verse 2]\nI put on for my city from the seventeen\nKnew exactly what I wanted when I was seventeen\nI worked hard for a job and then I was selling green\nAnd now my goals is some type of money you've never seen\nStraight touching all of my targets without a laser beam\nYou're losing out, think it's time to get with the winning team\nMy niggas get at the money, you're always on the scene\nWhipping that work in that kitchen 'cause all they want is cream\nWhipped cream and some strawberries\nCouple boys that will eat it, I mean I know many\nBut when you're ripe and looking right that shit is ordinary\nI ain't giving all the sut for something momentary\nUh, dream so big, shit is kinda scary\nAll I want is my notes high like Mariah Carey\nMy niggas on shit, move diff, be wary\nYou man are actors, joke man, Jim Carey\nI'm tired of pointing out all the things that make you lame\nTryna be players before you even get in the game\nMe and my dawgs dem are hungry, no way to be tamed\nI'm tryna get my mind right, you better do the same\nI've been rolling with J like nothing ever changed\nNever forget the ones that taught you how to maintain\nI need my license but I'm thinking about wood grain\nI want that young money, cash money, Lil Wayne\n[Hook]\nThat money made my niggas rob the top shotter\nThat money turn your bitch into a cock-sucker\nWhat? She giving head for some red-bottoms\nCouple weeks later man that bitch got 'em\n\n[Bridge]\nBut it's nothing, if my money's right I'll probably cop 'em\nNew slaves came a long way from picking cotton\nBitches made themselves a target and I ain't forgotten\nFull Woolley, you ain't running if I fix dot 'emEmbed"
