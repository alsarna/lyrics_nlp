And as his cheeks grew warm with tears and blood, so too his heart grew cold. \n\n[Verse 2: Mordred]\nOh Warmonger, is this what you wanted?\nOh Warmonger, is this all you know?\nOh Warmonger, is your world so empty?\nJust friend or foe?\nOh, Warmonger, see ‘em flee before you\nOh, Warmonger, watch them fall\nOh, Warmonger, their flowing blood implores you:\nHeed its call\n\n[Chorus: Gawain]\nNow at last free of fear\nMy vision blurs with crimson, but I finally see\nHold brutality near\nAnd release the coiled violence that’s inside of me\n\n[Spoken Interlude: Jonny d'Ville]\nAnd so Gawain fought, and through it all heard the shrill keening of vicious laughter. And as his fear bled through his pistol’s mouth, he knew the laugh was his own. \n\n[Chorus: Mordred & Gawain]\n[overlapping]\nThere’s nothing left to say (The air is filled with screams)\nWe’re rotten to the core (Before I treated battle like it was a toy)\nAnd I will make them pay (But not in my darkest dreams)\nFor making me believe there’s more (Could I have ever felt this savage joy)\n\n[Outro: Mordred]\n…where will you run to?\n…where will you run to?\n…where will you run to?"
