    "lyrics": "Passion Of The Christ Lyrics(There's) too many people, too many dying\nToo many lying, too many crying\n\n(There's) too many voices, so little choices\nAt night I lie awake, feels like heartache\n\nFeels like heartache, how long will the night take\nHow long will the night take, it feels like heartache\n\nThe night has come, they say I rise crime rate\n[?] can't wait\n\nI rise my fist the thunder break through\nMake a wish who will you run to\n\n(There's) too many prisons taking away from family\nToo many reasons to lose your sanity\nI lie awake and let the visions take me\nThink of life and how it tried to break me\n\nHad no choice, had to settle\nHear a voice now they burn from metal\n\nThere's too many shouts and they call it treason\nCan't relate and hate without reason\n\n(There's) too many guns, pray for God to come quick\nHe doesn't come, my God is real sickEmbed"
