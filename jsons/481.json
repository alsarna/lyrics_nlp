He disappeared, babe\nAfter drawing out all his hard earned cash\nAnd now Macheath spends just like a sailor\nCould it be our boy's done something rash?\n\nNow, Jenny Diver, ho ho, Suky Tawdry\nOoh, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown\nOh, the line forms on the right, babe\nNow that Mackie's back in town\n\nI said, Jenny Diver, woah, Suky Tawdry\nLook out, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown\nYes, that line forms on the right, babe\nNow that Mackie's back in town\n\nLook out ol' Mackie is back6Embed"
