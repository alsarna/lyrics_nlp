Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\n[Verse 1]\nHe came to town like a midwinter storm\nHe rode through the fields, so handsome and strong\nHis eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun\nBut all he had come for was havin' some fun\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe brought disaster wherever he went\nThe hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent\nThey all ran away so nobody would know\nAnd left only men 'cause of Cotton-Eyed Joe\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe\nI'd been married long time ago\nWhere did you come from? Where did you go?\nWhere did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?9Embed"
