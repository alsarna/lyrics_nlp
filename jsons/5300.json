Is it going?\nI don't know what you're lookin' for\nOh, yeah, boy, come on\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]\nI'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye\nI'm real as it comes, if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y-y-y\nI seen you to try switch it up, but girl, you ain't that dope\nI'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope\nI'm a supermodel and mommy—sí, mami\nAmnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock\nLove my ass and my abs in the video called \"Promiscuous\"\nMy style is ri-dic-dic-diculous—'ulous—'ulous\n\n[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]\nIf you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice\nIf you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night\nWe ain't here to hurt nobody\n(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)\nWanna see you work your body\n(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)\n\n[Verse 2: Timbaland]\nWhen Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands\nI get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and\nNever gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand\nI'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan\nI'm a real producer, and you just a piano man\nYour songs don't top the charts—I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an\nNiggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance\nSomebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can\n[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]\nIf you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice\nIf you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night\nWe ain't here to hurt nobody\n(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)\nWanna see you work your body\n(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)\n\n[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]\nCould you speak up and stop mu-mumbling?\nI don't think you came in clear\nWhen you're sittin' on the top\nIt's hard to hear you from way up here\nNow I saw you tryna act cute on TV\n\"Just let me clear the air...\"\nWe missed you on the charts last week—\nDamn, that's right, you wasn't there\nNow if se-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi-i-it?\nDon't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it\nSo if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way\n'Cause our run will never be over—not, at least, until we say (Ugh)\n\n[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]\nIf you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice\nIf you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night\nWe ain't here to hurt nobody\n(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)\nWanna see you work your body\n(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)\n[Break: Nelly Furtado & (Justin Timberlake)]\nOh...
