    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOnce I had a secret love\nThat lived within the heart of me\nAll too soon my secret love\nBecame impatient to be free\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I told a friendly star\nThe way that dreamers often do\nJust how wonderful you are\nAnd why I'm so in love with you\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I shout it from the highest hills\nEven told the golden daffodils\nAt last my heart's an open door\nAnd my secret love is no secret anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I shout it from the highest hills\nEven told the golden daffodils\nAt last my heart's an open door\nAnd my secret love is no secret anymore"
