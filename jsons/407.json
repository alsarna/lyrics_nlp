This next one tells the story of Mister Grayson, a beautiful woman and a condemned man named Tom Dooley. When the sun rises tomorrow, Tom Dooley must hang\n\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nHang down your head and cry\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\n\nI met her on the mountain\nThere I took her life\nMet her on the mountain\nStabbed her with my knife\n\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nHang down your head and cry\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\n\nThis time tomorrow\nReckon where I'll be\nHadn't-a been for Grayson\nI'd-a been in Tennessee\n\nWell now, boy\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nHang down your head and cry\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\nHang down your head and try, Tom Dooley\nHang down your head and cry\nHang down your head and try, Tom Dooley\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\n\nThis time tomorrow\nReckon where I'll be\nDown in some lonesome valley\nHangin' from a white oak tree\n\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nHang down your head and cry\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\n\nWell now, boy\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nHang down your head and cry\nHang down your head, Tom Dooley\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\n\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\nPoor boy, you're bound to die\nPoor boy, you're bound to die"
