    "lyrics": "I can't cover up my feelings\nIn the name of love\nOr play it safe\nFor a while that was easy\n\nAnd if living for myself\nIs what I'm guilty of\nGo on and sentence me\nI'll still be free\n\nIt's my turn\nTo see what I can see\nI hope you'll understand\nThis time's just for me\n\nBecause it's my turn\nWith no apologies\nI've given up the truth\nTo those I've tried to please\n\nBut now it's my turn\nIf I don't have all the answers\nAt least I know\nI'll take my share of chances\nAin't no use of holding of\nWhen nothing stays the same\nSo I'll let it rain\nCause the rain ain't gonna hurt me\nAnd I'll let you go\nThough I know it won't be easy\n\nIt's my turn\nWith no more room for lies\nFor years I'd seen my life\nThrough someone else's eyes\n\nAnd now it's my turn\nTo try and find my way\nAnd if I should get lost\nAt least I'll own today\n\nIt's my turn\nYes, it's my turn\nAnd there ain't no use in holding of\nWhen nothing stays the same\n\nSo I'll let it rain\nCause the rain ain't gonna hurt me\nAnd I'll let you go\nThough I know it won't be easy\n\nIt's my turn\nTo see what I can see\nI hope you'll understand\nThis time's just for me\nBecause it's my turn\nTo turn and say goodbye\nI sure would like to know\nThat you're still on my side\n\nBecause it's my turn\nIt's my turn\n\nIt's my turn\nTo start from number one\nTrying to undo\nSome damage that's been done\n\nBut now it's my turn\nTo reach and touch the sky\nNo one's gonna say\nAt least I didn't try\n\nIt's my turn\nYes, it's my turn\n\nIt's my turn\nIt's my turn\nIt's my turn"
