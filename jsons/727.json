    "lyrics": "I'm so hurt\nTo think that you lied to me\nI'm hurt\nWay down deep inside me\nYou said your love was true\nAnd we'd never, ever part\nNow you want someone new\nAnd it breaks, it breaks my heart\n\nI'm so hurt\nMuch more than you'll ever know\nYes, darling, I'm so hurt\nBecause, I still love you so\nBut... but, even... even though you hurt me\nLike nobody else could ever do\nI would never ever hurt... hurt you"
