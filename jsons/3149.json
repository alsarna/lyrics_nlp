(oh, no, no no)\nNow would I say something that wasn't true?\nI'm asking you sugar, would I lie to you?\n\nMy friends know what's in store\nI won't be here anymore\nI've packed my bags\nI've cleaned the floor\nWatch me walking\nWalking out the door\n\n(Believe me) I'll make it, make it\n(Believe me) I'll make it, make it\n\nWould I lie to you?\nWould I lie to you honey? (oh honey, would I lie to you?)\nNow would I say something that wasn't true?\nI'm asking you sugar, would I lie to you?\n\nTell you straight, no intervention\nTo your face, no deception\nYou're the biggest fake\nThat much is true\nHad all I can take\nNow I'm leaving you\n(Believe me) I'll make it, make it (oh yes, I will)\n(Believe me) I'll make it, make it (make it, make it)\n\nWould I lie to you?\nWould I lie to you honey?\nNow would I say something that wasn't true?\nI'm asking you sugar, would I lie?\n\nWould I lie to you?\nWould I lie to you honey?\nNow would I say something that wasn't true?\nI'm asking you sugar\nWould I lie to you?\n\nMy friends know what's in store\nI won't be here anymore\nI've packed my bags\nI've cleaned the floor\nWatch me walking\nWalking out the door\n\n(Believe me) Watch me, watch me\n(Believe me) Watch me, watch me, yes I will, yeah\n\nWould I lie to you?"
