    "lyrics": "To live for today and to love for tomorrow\nIs the wisdom of a fool\nBecause tomorrow is promised to no one\nYou see love is that wonderful thing that the whole wide world needs plenty of\nAnd if you think for one minute that you can live without it\nThen you are only fooling yourself\nListen please I'd like to tell you something that happened to me just the other day\n\nI awakened this morning, I was filled with despair\nAll my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah\nAs I looked at my life it was barren and bare\nWithout love I've had nothing at all\n\nWithout love I've had nothing\nWithout love I've had nothing at all\nI have conquered the world\nAll but one thing did I have\nWithout love I've had nothing at all\n\nOnce I had a sweetheart who loved only me\nThere was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no\nBut I was blind to her goodness and I could not see\nThat a heart without love cannot live\n\nWithout love I've had nothing\nWithout love I've had nothing at all\nI have conquered the world\nAll but one thing did I have\nWithout love I've had nothing at all"
