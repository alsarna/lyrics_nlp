(Yeah)\n'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one\nYou see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)\n'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this\nIf you're on your way\nI'm not gonna write you (I want you) to stay\nIf your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute\nBabe, I'll walk the seven seas (Walk the seven seas)\nWhen I believe that there's a reason\nTo write you (Write you) a love song today\nToday (Yeah), yeah24Embed"
