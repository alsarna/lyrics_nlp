    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf I could save time in a bottle\nThe first thing that I'd like to do\nIs to save every day till eternity passes away\nJust to spend them with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I could make days last forever\nIf words could make wishes come true\nI'd save every day like a treasure and then\nAgain, I would spend them with you\n\n[Chorus]\nBut there never seems to be enough time\nTo do the things you want to do, once you find them\nI've looked around enough to know\nThat you're the one I want to go through time with\n[Verse 3]\nIf I had a box just for wishes\nAnd dreams that had never come true\nThe box would be empty, except for the memory of how\nThey were answered by you\n[Chorus]\nBut there never seems to be enough time\nTo do the things you want to do, once you find them\nI've looked around enough to know\nThat you're the one I want to go through time with\n\n[Outro]"
