    "lyrics": "Silhouettes LyricsTook a walk and passed your house late last night\nAll the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight\nFrom within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade\nOh, what a lovely couple they made\n\nPut his arms around your waist, held you tight\nKisses I could almost taste in the night\nWondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade\nI couldn't hide the tears in my eyes\n\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\n\nLost control and rang your bell, I was sore\nLet me in or else I'll beat down your door\nWhen two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade\nSaid to my shock you're on the wrong block\nRushed down to your house with wings on my feet\nLoved you like I'd never loved your my sweet\nVowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade\nAll of our days, two silhouettes on the shade\n\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah1Embed"
