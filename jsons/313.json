    "lyrics": "It's not for me to say, you love me\nIt's not for me to say, you'll always care\nOh.. but here for the moment\nI can hold you fast\nAnd press your lips to mine\nAnd dream that love will last\n\nAs far as I can see, this is heaven\nAnd speaking just for me, It's ours to share\nPerhaps the glow\nOf love will grow\nWith every passing day\nOr we may never meet again\nBut then\nIt's not for me to say\n\n(Break)\n\nAnd speaking just for me\nIt's ours to share\nPerhaps the glow\nOf love will grow\nWith every passing day\nOr we may never meet again\nBut then\nIt's not for me to say"
