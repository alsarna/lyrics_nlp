    "lyrics": "Everlasting Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go\nI went away, just when you, you needed me so\nFilled with regret, I come back begging you\nForgive, forget. Where's the love we once knew?\n\n[Chorus 1]\nOpen up your eyes, then you'll realize\nHere I stand with my, everlasting love\nNeed you by my side, girl to be my bride\nYou'll never be denied, everlasting love\nFrom the very start, open up your heart\nBe a lasting part of everlasting love\n\n(Need a love to last forever)\n(Need a love to last forever)\n[Chorus 2]\nWhere life's river flows, no one really knows\nTill someone's there to show the way to lasting love\nLike the sun shines, endlessly it shines\nYou always will be mine, it's eternal love\nWhen other's love-light's gone, ours will be strong\nWe'll have our very own, everlasting love\n\n(Real love to last forever)\n(Real love to last forever)\n\n[Chorus 1]\nOpen up your eyes, then you'll realize\nHere I stand with my, everlasting love\nNeed you by my side, girl to be my bride\nYou'll never be denied, everlasting love\nFrom the very start, open up your heart\nBe a lasting part of everlasting loveEmbed"
