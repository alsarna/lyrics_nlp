    "lyrics": "Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas\nAin't nothin' but a fool would live like this\nOut all night and runnin' wild\nWoman's sittin' home with a month old child\n\nDang me, dang me\nThey oughta take a rope and hang me\nHigh from the highest tree\nWoman would you weep for me?\n\nJust sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys\nSix rounds bought and I bought five\nI spent the groceries and a half the rent\nI lack fourteen dollars havin' twenty seven cents\n\nDang me, dang me\nThey oughta take a rope and hang me\nHigh from the highest tree\nWoman would you weep for me?\n\nThey say roses are red and violets are purple\nAnd sugar's sweet and so is maple syrple\nWell I'm seventh out of seven sons\nMy pappy was a pistol, I'm a son of a gun\n\nI said dang me, dang me\nThey oughta take a rope and hang me\nHigh from the highest tree\nWoman would you weep for me?"
