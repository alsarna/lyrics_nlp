(South Street, South Street)\nWhere the dancin' is elite (South Street, South Street)\nSide by side we're loose and neat\nWhen we're stompin' down the street\nHurry down, baby she's the hippest street in town!(Oh baby)\n\nMeet me, on South Street, oh yeah, hurry on down\nCome on now, meet me on South Street\nThe hippest street in town\nWell you take West Street, East Street, North Avenue\n(Cause I know) South Street's the best street\nTo have a ball with you\n\nDo you hear that groovy beat? (South Street, South Street)\nDon't it make you move your feet? (South Street, South Street)\nEverybody gathers round\nCause they dig that crazy sound\nNow hurry down, baby she's the hippest street in town\n(Oh baby) Meet me on South Street, (come on) oh yeah, hurry on down\nCome on now, meet me on South Street, the hippest street in town\n(Well you take) West Street, East Street, North Avenue\n(Cause I know) South Street's the best street\nTo have a ball with you\n\n(Oh baby) Meet me on South Street, (come on) oh yeah, hurry on down\nCome on now, meet me on South Street, the hippest street in town\n(Well you take) West Street, East Street, North Avenue\n(Cause I know) South Street's the best street\nTo have a ball with youEmbed"
