    "lyrics": "Bang Bang LyricsI was five and he was six\nWe rode on horses made of sticks\nI wore black you wore white\nYou would always win the fight\n\nBang bang, you shoot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shoot me down\n\nSeasons came and change the time\nI grew up I called you mine\nYou would always laugh and say\nRemember when we used to play\n\nBang bang, I shot you down\nBang bang, you hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, I used to shoot you down\nMusic played and people sang\nJust for me the church bells rangâ€¦\n\nNow he's gone I don't know why\nAnd 'till these days sometimes I cry\nHe didn't say goodbye\nHe didn't take the time to lie\n\nBang bang, he shot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shot me downEmbed"
