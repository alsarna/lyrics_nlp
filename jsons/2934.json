Lyrics[Intro]\nPlease, please tell me now\nPlease, please tell me now\nPlease, please tell me now\nPlease, please tell me now\n\n[Verse 1]\nI made a break, I run out yesterday\nTried to find my mountain hideaway\nMaybe next year, maybe no go\n\nI know you're watching me\nEvery minute of the day, yeah\nI've seen the signs\nAnd the looks and the pictures\nThat give your game away, yeah\nThere's a dream that strings the road\nWith broken glass for us to hold\nAnd I cut so far before I had to say\n\n[Chorus 1]\nPlease, please tell me now\nIs there something I should know?\nIs there something I should say\nThat would make you come my way?\nDo you feel the same?\n'Cause you don't let it show\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople stare and cross the road from me\nAnd jungle drums\nThey all clear the way for me\nCan you read my mind?\nCan you see in the snow?\n\nAnd fiery demons all dance\nWhen you walk through that door\nDon't say you're easy on me\nYou're about as easy as a nuclear war\n\nThere's a dream that strings the road\nWith broken glass for us to hold\nAnd I cut so far before I had to say\n[Chorus 1]\nPlease, please tell me now\nIs there something I should know?\nIs there something I should say\nThat would make you come my way?\nDo you feel the same?\n'Cause you don't let it show\n\nPlease, please tell me now\nIs there something I should know?\nIs there something I should say\nThat would make you come my way?\nPlease, please tell me now\nCan you see what makes me blow?\nCan you see how much I'd die\nEvery time it passes by?\nPlease, please tell me now\nWhat it takes to make it show\nIs there something I should know?\nIs there something I should know?2Embed"
