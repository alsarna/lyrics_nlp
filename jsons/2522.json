    "lyrics": "I've cried through many endless nights\nJust holding my pillow tight\nThen you came into my lonely days\nWith your tender love and sweet ways\nNow I don't know where you come from baby\nDon't know where you been now baby\nHeaven must have sent you into my arms\n\nNow in the morning when I awake\nThere's a smile upon my face\nYou touch my heart with gladness\nWiped away all of my sadness\nOh so long I've needed love right near me\nA soft voice to cheer me\nHeaven must have sent you baby into my life\n\nOoh it's heaven in your arms\nIt's the sweetness of your charms\nMakes me love you more each day\nIn your arms I wanna stay\n\nWanna thank you for the joy youve brought me\nThank you for the things you taught me\nThank you for holding me close\nWhen I needed you the most\nNow I dont know much about you baby\nBut I know I can't live without you\nHeaven must have sent you honey\nTo love only me\nIt's heaven in your arms\nIt's the sweetness of your charms\nMakes me love you more each day\nIn your arms I wanna stay"
