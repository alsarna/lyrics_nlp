All the twisted games\nAll the questions you used to avoid\nAin't it funny? Remember I brought her up\nAnd you told me I was paranoid?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou betrayed me\nAnd I know that you'll never feel sorry\nFor the way I hurt, yeah\nYou talked to her when we were together\nLoved you at your worst, but that didn't matter\nIt took you two weeks to go off and date her\nGuess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor\n[Bridge]\n(Ah-ah-ah)\nGod, I wish that you had thought this through\nBefore I went and fell in love with you\n(Ah-ah-ah)\nWhen she's sleepin' in the bed we made\nDon't you dare forget about the way\n\n[Chorus]\nYou betrayed me\n'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry\nFor the way I hurt, yeah\nYou talked to her when we were together\nYou gave me your word, but that didn't matter\nIt took you two weeks to go off and date her\nGuess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor\n(Ah-ah-ah)\nYeah, you're still a traitor\n\n[Outro]\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nGod, I wish that you had thought this through\nBefore I went and fell in love with you123Embed"
