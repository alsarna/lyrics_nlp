    "lyrics": "Itâ€™s All in the Game LyricsMany a tear have to fall\nBut it's all in the game\nAll in the wonderful game\nThat we know as love\n\nYou have words with him\nAnd your future's looking dim\nBut these things\nYour hearts can rise above\n\nOnce in a while he will call\nBut it's all in the game\nSoon he'll be there at your side\nWith a sweet bouquet\n\nAnd he'll kiss your lips\nAnd caress your waiting fingertips\nAnd your hearts will fly\nAway\n(Soon he'll be there at your side)\nWith a sweet bouquet\nThen he'll kiss your lips\nAnd caress your waiting fingertips\nAnd your hearts will fly\nAwayEmbed"
