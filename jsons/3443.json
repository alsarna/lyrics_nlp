    "lyrics": "Perfect World LyricsEverybody's looking for the perfect world\nWhere you could have everything your heart desires\nThe perfect boy will meet the perfect girl\nAnd the perfect love will set the world on fire\n\nWell what you gonna do, when one and one makes three\nAnd a vision of the future is impossible to see\nNobody's perfect, not even a perfect fool\nIf you'll have faith in me\nI'll keep faith with you\n\nAin't no livin' in a perfect world\nThere ain't no perfect world anyway\nAin't no livin' in a perfect world\nBut we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world\nKeep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world\nEverybody's got secrets, now you know that it's true\nThey talk about me and they'll talk about you\nSomething happens to the pledges of trust\nDown through the years they begin to rust\n\nNow here we are amid the tears and the laughter\nStill waiting for our happily ever after\nWe'll keep on dreamin' as long as we can\nTry to remember and you'll understand\n\nAin't no livin' in a perfect world\nThere ain't no perfect world anyway\nAin't no livin' in a perfect world\nBut we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world\nKeep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect worldEmbed"
