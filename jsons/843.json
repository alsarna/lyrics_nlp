    "lyrics": "See the pyramids along the Nile\nWatch the sun rise on a tropic isle\nJust remember, darling, all the while\nYou belong to me\n\nSee the marketplace in old Algiers\nSend me photographs and souvenirs\nBut remember when a dream appears\nYou belong to me\n\nI'll be so alone without you\nMaybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue\n\nFly the ocean in a silver plane\nWatch the jungle when its wet with rain\nJust remember till youre home again\nYou belong to me"
