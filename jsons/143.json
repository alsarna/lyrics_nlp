    "lyrics": "Changing Partners LyricsWe were waltzin' together to a dreamy melody\nWhen they called out \"Change partners\"\nAnd you waltzed away from me\nNow my arms feel so empty as I gaze around the floor\nAnd I'll keep on changing partners\nTill I hold you once more\n\nThough we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part\nIn that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart\nSo I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then\nOh, my darlin' I will never change partners again\n\nThough we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part\nIn that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart\nSo I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then\nOh, my darlin' I will never change partners againEmbed"
