    "lyrics": "The wayward wind is a restless wind\nA restless wind that yearns to wander\nAnd he was born the next of kin\nThe next of kin to the wayward wind\n\nIn a lonely shack by a railroad track\nHe spent his younger days\nAnd I guess the sound of the outward-bound\nMade him a slave to his wandering ways\n\nAnd the wayward wind is a restless wind\nA restless wind that yearns to wander\nAnd he was born the next of kin\nThe next of kin to the wayward wind\n\nOh I met him there in a border town\nHe vowed we'd never part\nThough he tried his best to settle down\nI'm now alone with a broken heart\n\nAnd the wayward wind is a restless wind\nA restless wind that yearns to wander\nAnd he was born the next of kin\nThe next of kin to the wayward wind\nThe next of kin to the wayward wind"
