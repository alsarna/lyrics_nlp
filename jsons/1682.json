I’m the fattest of them all\nBeen rapping since a younger I was rapping back in school\nI smack it when I’m rapping and I’m overlapping fools\nThe best when under pressure and my back’s against the wall\nWe back Charlie tell me where to begin\nI’ve been fat for so long I’m probably scared to be thin\nAnd where are my kins? All shoutin’ lose weight!\nBut like a couple of copies man trust I think it’s too late\nMy whole life man I’ve repped it different\nLord knows I wanted was some recognition\nPlease just listen ‘fore Biggie busts his load\nGirls say I look cute, “I love his chode”\nBut I rub their throat ‘til their husband’s home\nI got all my nerds saying we don’t love these hoes\nFlip my phone when I bone I don’t trust these phones\nBut the truth is I don’t really fuck these hoes\nI’m still a virgin and man I’m learning\nAnd last week I had a bad bitch twerking\nWe was flirting, oh I was certain!\nOh she’s a stripper and she was only working?!\nI get nervous and then I start stammering\nLove a BBW I always dibble dabble in\nTrying to find a chick so I can’t start the hammering\nTrying to find my dick, better luck finding Madeline\nAnd Instagram chicks really getting bored of ‘em\nGotten to the point I just start ignoring ‘em\nI talk numbers always end up boring ‘em\nWhy my sexual fantasy’s fucking Carole Vorderman\nAnd Big bad Heath we ain’t talking gun crime\nI could beat your whole catalog with like one line\nMy punchlines are dumb fine\nFuck you and your bum rhyme\nBullies back in lunchtime, brother this is crunch time!\nAnd I’m a heavy don arrogant and never wrong\nLet alone a boner I’m just trying to get a semi-on\nThe game’s full of bitches all they need is femidom\nCharlie man I clocked you can’t please everyone\nI built a brand from the bottom with no name\nYou should hear my Nan she’s playing her bowls games\n“He’s working hard, he wants the whole game!\nAnd one day Derek I’m sure he’ll have gold chains”\nAnd being down to Earth’s the only way I had to be\nAll the glitz and glammer is nothing like my family\nBut tragically I’ve always been a cunt bro\nI say it’s fine for stage fright then boo him at the front row\nI paint a picture more vivid than Spike Lee\nMarried to the game I went on my right knee\nBrothers they spike me ‘cos they can’t outwrite me\nCourse you don’t like HEATH, you are not like me\nOf course I go sick I’m born for this shit\nIt’s no doubt I had to get Diztortion on this\nThe most normal of kids I want four different whips\nI want a Stella in my hand a portion of chips\n[Verse 3]\nLet me be clear half of these artists are just damn lame\nThey sell their sole the moment they find some fan-fame\nI’m here to bring a little humour the rap game\nSo in the comments tell me if it’s plantin or plantain\nThis year I tried for jolla the first time\nI can’t lie I must admit the shit was quite nice\nAt first I thought it was just a portion of rice\nBut with a little spice, mm that’s darn nice\nRight you know I’m flowing it cold\nAnd lord knows I’m getting bored of mum’s toad in the hole\nYou need some spice mum, I’m being nice mum\nI’m not racist but you’re really too white mum\nSee what’s logic if it isn’t backed with reasoning\nBut mum please stop cooking chicken with no seasoning\nI swear the game’s changed the game’s past treason\nThese rappers let down like Game of Throne’s last season\nAnd I’m sick and tired of rappers feeling like I’ve got something to prove\nCos I’m not a big trapper just in love with the booth\nCos you don’t know about those nights I was stuck in my room\nTo get away from all the bullies it was something to prove\nAnd yes I am overweight but I can stomach the truth\nAnd you ain't gotta sell drugs to be a hustler dude\nI coulda had a good job I got something to lose\nSo don’t you ever dare question or judge what I do\nIt’s nothing but truth I hope you’re getting the message\nI’m from a different walk of life it’s no lesser a lesson\nBut you acting big ‘cos you know Dennis the Menace\nI can’t relate to all that shit, I play tennis with Dennis\nAnd I was gonna rap some drill Charlie I swear I nearly bought a mask\nI decided I’d be Peter Pan but in the end I thought I’d pass\nI can’t run from feds, you never see me walking fast\nStill I’m up in Nando’s putting Fanta in the water glass\nAnd real shit I don’t do this for the clout no\nThese bad thoughts just the way I let them out bro\nAnd if you need help please then please shout bro\nOne love to Charlie and the team I’m out though"
