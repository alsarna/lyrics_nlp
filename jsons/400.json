    "lyrics": "Take out the papers and the trash\nOr you don't get no spendin' cash\nIf you don't scrub that kitchen floor\nYou ain't gonna rock and roll no more\nYakety yak (don't talk back)\nJust finish cleanin' up your room\nLet's see that dust fly with that broom\nGet all that garbage out of sight\nOr you don't go out Friday night\nYakety yak (don't talk back)\nYou just put on your coat and hat\nAnd walk yourself to the laundromat\nAnd when you finish doin' that\nBring in the dog and put out the cat\nYakety yak (don't talk back)\n\nDon't you give me no dirty looks\nYour father's hip; he knows what cooks\nJust tell your hoodlum friend outside\nYou ain't got time to take a ride\n\nYakety yak (don't talk back)\nYakety yak, yakety yak\nYakety yak, yakety yak\nYakety yak, yakety yak\n[Fade]\nYakety yak, yakety yak"
