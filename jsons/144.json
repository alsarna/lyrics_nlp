(ooh!)\n\nPapa loves mambo\n(Papa loves mambo)\nMama loves mambo\n(Mama loves mambo)\nPapa does great with it, swings like a gate with it\nHe loses weight with it, now!\n\nHe goes to, she goes fro\nHe goes fast, she goes slow\nHe goes left 'n' she goes right\n(Papa's lookin' for mama but mama is nowhere in sight) oooh!\n\nPapa loves mambo\nMama loves mambo\nHavin' their fling again, younger than Spring again\nFeelin' that zing again, wow! (ooh!)\n\nPapa loves mambo\n(Papa loves mambo)\nMama loves mambo\n(Mama loves mambo)\nDon't let her rumba and don't let her samba\nCause papa loves mama tonight (ooh!)\n(Papa loves mambo)\n(Mama loves mambo)\n\n(Papa loves mambo)\n(Mama loves mambo)\n\nHe goes to, she goes fro\nHe goes fast, she goes slow\nHe goes left 'n' she goes right\n(Papa's lookin' for mama but mama is nowhere in sight) (ooh!)\n\nPapa loves mambo\n(Papa loves mambo)\nMama loves mambo\n(Mama loves mambo)\nHavin' their fling again, younger than Spring again\nFeelin' that zing again, wow! (ooh!)\n\n(Papa loves mambo)\nMambo papa\n(Mama loves mambo)\nMambo mama\n(Don't let her rumba and don't let her samba)\nCause papa--\nLoves a mambo tonight\n(ooh!)"
