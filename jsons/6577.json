(Oh)\nTry to open up and love more (Love more)\nTry to open up and love more\n\n[Bridge: Scootie, Ariana Grande & Both]\nIf you were my boyfriend\nAnd you were my girlfriend\nI prolly wouldn't see nobody else\nBut I can't guarantee that by myself\n[Chorus: Ariana Grande]\nYou ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you ain't my boyfriend)\nAnd I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, I ain't your girlfriend)\nBut you don't want me to see nobody else (Nobody)\nAnd I don't want you to see nobody\nBut you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you know you ain't my boyfriend)\nAnd I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, yeah, mmm)\nBut you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)\nBaby, we ain't gotta tell nobody (Oh yeah)\nYou ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)\nAnd I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)\nBut you don't want me to see nobody else\nAnd I don't want you to see nobody\nBut you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)\nAnd I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, yeah)\nBut you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)\nBaby, we ain't gotta tell nobody"
