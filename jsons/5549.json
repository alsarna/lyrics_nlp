    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy best friend gave me the best advice\nHe said each day's a gift and not a given right\nLeave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind\nAnd try to take the path less traveled by\nThat first step you take is the longest stride\n(What if, what if?)\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIf today was your last day\nAnd tomorrow was too late\nCould you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)\nWould you live each moment like your last?\nLeave old pictures in the past?\nDonate every dime you have?\n(What if, what if?)\nIf today was your last day\n(What if, what if?)\n(If today was your last day)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAgainst the grain should be a way of life\nWhat's worth the prize is always worth the fight\nEvery second counts 'cause there's no second try\nSo live like you'll never live it twice\nDon't take the free ride in your own life\n(What if, what if?)\n[Chorus 2]\nIf today was your last day\nAnd tomorrow was too late\nCould you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)\nWould you live each moment like your last?\nLeave old pictures in the past?\nDonate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)\nAnd would you call old friends you never see?\nReminisce old memories?\nWould you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)\nWould you find that one you're dreamin' of?\nSwear up and down to God above\nThat you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)\nIf today was your last day\n\n[Bridge]\nIf today was your last day\nWould you make your mark by mending a broken heart?\nYou know it's never too late to shoot for the stars\nRegardless of who you are\nSo do whatever it takes (Takes)\n'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life\nLet nothin' stand in your way (Way)\n'Cause the hands of time are never on your side\n\n[Chorus 2]\nIf today was your last day\nAnd tomorrow was too late\nCould you say goodbye to yesterday?\nWould you live each moment like your last?\nLeave old pictures in the past?\nDonate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)\nAnd would you call old friends you never see?\nReminisce old memories?\nWould you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)\nWould you find that one you're dreamin' of?\nSwear up and down to God above\nThat you finally fall in love? (What if, what if?)\nIf today was your last day"
