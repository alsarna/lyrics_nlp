    "lyrics": "She's faced the hardest times you could imagine\nAnd many times her eyes fought back the tears\nAnd when her youthful world was about to fall in\nEach time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears\nAnd a sorrow no one hears still rings in midnight silence in her ears\n\nLet her cry for she's a lady\nLet her dream for she's a child\nLet the rain fall down upon her\nShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild\n\nAnd if by chance I should hold her\nLet me hold her for a time\nBut if allowed just one possession\nI would pick her from the garden to be mine\n\nBe careful how you touch her, for she'll awaken\nAnd sleep's the only freedom that she knows\nAnd when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe\nThe way she's always paying for a debt she never owes\nAnd a silent wind still blows that only she can hear\nAnd so she goes\n\nLet her cry for she's a lady\nLet her dream for she's a child\nLet the rain fall down upon her\nShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild\nLet her cry for she's lady\nLet her dream for she's a child\nLet the rain fall down upon her\nShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild\n\nShe's a flower growing wild\nShe's free"
