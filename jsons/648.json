    "lyrics": "Why did you say goodbye to me\nNow I'm as lonely as could be\nAnd as I feel a teardrop fall\nI hear your footsteps down the hall\nWalkin' away from me\n\nWhy did you say goodbye\nWhy did you make me cry\nNow, every day I wonder why\nWhy, oh why, oh why, oh\nFootsteps, footsteps\nFootsteps, footsteps\nYou're such a haunting memory\nI pray that you'll come back to me\nBut as I say my evening prayers\nI hear your footsteps on the stairs\nWalkin' away from me\n\nWhy did you say goodbye\nWhy did you make me cry\nNow, every day I wonder why\nWhy, oh why, oh why, oh\n\nFootsteps, footsteps\nFootsteps, footsteps\nFootsteps, footsteps\nFootsteps"
