    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOh I could hide 'neath the wings of the blue bird as she sings\nThe six o'clock alarm would never ring\nBut it rings and we rise wipe the sleep out of our eyes\nThe shaving razor's cold and it stings\n\n[Chorus]\nCheer up sleepy Jean oh what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer and a homecoming queen\n\n[Verse 2]\nI once thought of you as a white knight on a steed\nNow you know how happy we can be\nOh when our good times started then\nNot a dollar one to spend\nBut how much baby do we really need"
