    "lyrics": "You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain\nToo much love drives a man insane\nYou broke my will\nBut what a thrill\nGoodness gracious, great balls of fire!\n\nI laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny\nBut you came along and you moved me honey\nI've changed my mind\nThis love is fine\nGoodness gracious, great balls of fire!\n\nKiss me baby\nOoh, it feels good\nHold me baby, yeah\nYou gotta let me love you like a lover should\nYou’re fine, so kind\nI’m gon‘ tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine\n\nI chew my nails, I twiddle my thumbs\nI'm gettin‘ nervous honey, but it sure is fun\nCome on baby, you drive me crazy\nGoodness gracious, great balls of fire!\n\n(Piano solo)\nOh, kiss me baby\nOoh, feels good, yeah\nLet me love you like a lover should\nYou're fine, so kind\nI’m gon’ tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine\n\nI chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs\nI'm real nervous but it sure is fun\nCome on baby, you’re driving me crazy\nGoodness gracious, great balls of fire!"
