    "lyrics": "Drop your silver in my tambourine\nHelp a poor man fill a pretty dream\nGive me pennies, I'll take anything\nNow listen while I play\nMy green tambourine\n\nWatch the jingle jangle start to shine\nReflections of the music that is mine\nWhen you toss a coin, you'll hear it sing\nNow listen while I play\nMy green tambourine\n\nDrop a dime before I walk away\nAny song you want, I'll gladly play\nMoney feeds my music machine\nNow listen while I play\nMy green tambourine\n\nListen and I'll play"
