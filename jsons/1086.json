You know I need someone\n(Help!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I was younger so much younger than today\nI never needed anybody's help in any way\nBut now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured\nNow I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors\n\n[Chorus]\nHelp me if you can, I'm feeling down\nAnd I do appreciate you being 'round\nHelp me get my feet back on the ground\nWon't you please, please help me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd now my life has changed in oh so many ways\nMy independence seems to vanish in the haze\nBut every now and then I feel so insecure\nI know that I just need you like I've never done before\n\n[Chorus]\nHelp me if you can, I'm feeling down\nAnd I do appreciate you being 'round\nHelp me get my feet back on the ground\nWon't you please, please help me?\n[Verse 3 ]\nWhen I was younger, so much younger than today\nI never needed anybody's help in any way\nBut now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured\nNow I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors\n\n[Chorus]\nHelp me if you can, I'm feeling down\nAnd I do appreciate you being 'round\nHelp me get my feet back on the ground\nWon't you please, please help me?\nHelp me? Help me? Ooh"
