    "lyrics": "Where's this place called \"Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?\"\n\nI'm looking for that lonely street\nI've got a sad, sad tale to tell\nI need a place to go and weep\nWhere's this place called \"Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?\"\n\nA place where there's just loneliness\nWhere dim lights bring forgetfulness\nWhere broken dreams and mem'ries meet\nWhere's this place called \"Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?\"\n\nPerhaps upon that lonely street\nThere's someone such as I\nWho came to bury broken dreams\nAnd watch an old love di-ie\n\nIf I could find that lonely street\nWhere dim lights bring forgetfulness\nWhere broken dreams and mem'ries meet\nWhere's this place called \"Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?\"\n\nWhere's this place called \"Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?\""
