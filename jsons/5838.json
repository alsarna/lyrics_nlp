Such a crime, not a single word\nSippin' on that Patrón, just to calm my nerves\nUh-oh, poppin’ bottles by the phone, oh yeah\nHad me up, had me down, turned me inside out\nThat’s enough, call me up, baby, I’m in doubt\nUh-oh, and I don’t even think you know\nNo, no, no\n\n[Chorus: Amy]\nSee, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby\nSo let’s get up, let’s get on it\nDon’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight\nCome on, that’s right\nHonest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to\nSo can we finish what we started?\nDon’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight\nCome on, that’s right, cheerio, ay\n\n[Bridge: Amy]\nAnything you wanna do, I’ll be on it too\nEverything you said, is like gold with a view\nBusiness in the front, party in the back\nMaybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?\nThis kinda thing doesn’t happen usually\nI’m on the opposite side of it, truthfully\nI know you want it, so come and get it\nCheerio\n[Chorus: Amy]\nSee, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nSo let’s get up, let’s get on it\nDon’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Oh-oh-whoa-oh, yeah)\nHonest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to (Thing that you want)\nSo can we finish what we started?\nDon’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Hey!)\nCome on, uh, that’s right!
