    "lyrics": "I want your eyes to see my eyes\nI want your lips to touch my lips\nI want your love to be my love forever more\n\nCan you find it in your heart to forgive me\nI was thoughtless heaven knows I acted badly\nBut the love I once gave to you so gladly\nCan you find it in your heart\n\nCan't we make another start, please forgive me\nI'm repenting and your arms alone can save me\nSo if carelessly I lost the love you gave me\nCan you find it in your heart\n\nDay and night I want your eyes to see my eyes\nI want your lips to touch my lips\nI want your love to be my love forever more\nAnd never never more to part\n\nMust you tell me that it's over? think it over\nThough I once betrayed your love, forgive the treason\nAnd my darling if your mind can't find the reason\nCan you find it in your heart"
