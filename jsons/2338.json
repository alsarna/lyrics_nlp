There's a new kid in town\nEverybody loves him, don't they?\nHe's holding her and you're still around\n\n[Outro]\nOh, my, my\nThere's a new kid in town\nJust another new kid in town\n(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's talking 'bout the\n(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town\n(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's walking like the\n(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town\nThere's a new kid in town\nI don't want to hear it\nThere's a new kid in town\nI don't want to hear it, ah-ooh\nThere's a new kid in town\nThere's a new kid in town\nThere's a new kid in town\nEverybody's talking\nThere's a new kid in town\nPeople started walking\nThere's a new kid in town\nThere's a new kid in town\nThere's a new kid in town\nThere's a new kid in town2Embed"
