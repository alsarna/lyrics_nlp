    "lyrics": "Dear one, the world is waiting for the sunrise\nEvery rose is covered with dew\nAnd while the world is waiting for the sunrise\nIn my heart is calling you\n\nDear one, the world is waiting for the sunrise\nEvery little rose bud is covered with dew\nAnd my heart is calling for you\nThe thrush on high, his sleepy mate is calling\nAnd my heart is calling you"
