Lyrics[Intro: Darkchild]\nWoo!\nYeah, Darkchild\nUh, B-Rocka\nLet's go\n\n[Verse 1: Brandy]\nWhy don't you return my calls?\nWhy you trip 'bout where I be?\nYou don't ever come to see me\nYou say that you're too busy (what?)\nWhat the hell? I don't have time\nWhy you messin' with my mind?\nI can find another guy\nSomeone who will treat me right\n[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]\nI don't need this bull-ish\nI won't put up with it any longer\nYou can go if you want\nI don't need your pity\nI will be just fine\nIf you decide that you want to leave\nClose the door behind you\nI just want to know what\n\n[Chorus: Brandy & (Darkchild)]\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave?\nWhat about all of the things you told me?\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave?\nWhat about, what about, what about us? (What about it?)\nWhat about us? (And what about it?)\nWhat about us? (Uh, what about it?)\nWhat about us? (What about us, uh?)\n\n[Verse 2: Brandy]\nThought you said you were different\nWas that what I heard you say?\nSaid that you'd love only me\nThought that you'd be all I need (what?)\nWhat happened to promises?\nSaid that you were a better man\nYour words have no weight with me\nCause you're counterfeit, I see\n[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]\nI don't need this bull-ish\nI won't put up with it any longer\nYou can go if you want\nI don't need your pity\nI will be just fine\nIf you decide that you want to leave\nClose the door behind you\nI just want to know what\n\n[Chorus: Brandy & (Darkchild)]\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave?\nWhat about all of the things you told me?\nWhat about all of the things that you said?\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave?\nWhat about, what about, what about us? (What about it?)\nWhat about us? (And what about it?)\nWhat about us? (What about it?)\nWhat about us? (What about us?)\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby, check it out, hear this\nNow, what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with?\nNow, what if I told you the game we played, I picked it?\nNow, what if I said it wasn't true, so do you?\nYou and I know, without me there's no you\nSo what about bills that were passed due, paid for you?\nAnd all you said to me is, \"Baby, I owe you\"\nForget about the brand-new life that I gave you\nDon't \"what about us?\" to me, 'cause we are through\n(Don't \"what about us?\" to me, what about us?)\n[Chorus: Brandy & (Darkchild)]\nWhat about all of the things that you said? (What about em?)\nWhat about all of the promises that you made? (Woo!)\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave? (Uh-huh)\nWhat about all of the things you told me? (Yeah)\nWhat about all of the things that you said? (Uh-huh)\nWhat about all of the promises that you made? (Uh-huh)\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave? (C'mon)\nWhat about, what about, what about us? (B-Rocka)\nWhat about all of the things that you said? (Let's go)\nWhat about all of the promises that you made? (C'mon)\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave? (Yeah)\nWhat about all of the things you told me? (Yeah)\nWhat about all of the things that you said? (Uh-huh)\nWhat about all of the promises that you made?(C'mon)\nWhat about all of the eyes that you gave? (Let's go)\nWhat about, what about, what about us?(C'mon, B-Rocka)\nWhat about us? (B-Rocka)\nWhat about us? (B-B-B-B-Rocka, y'all)\nWhat about us? (It's B-Rocka, y'all, F.J.)\n\n[Outro: Brandy & (Darkchild)]\nUh-huh (Uh-uh, Ray-J)\nUh-huh (Uh-uh, Big Shiz)\nUh-huh (Uh-uh, Big Bert)\nUh-huh (Uh-uh, J. Matthews)\nUh-huh (Uh-uh-uh, Fats)\nUh-huh (Uh-uh, Kenisha)\nUh-huh (Uh-uh-uh, B-Rocka, and Darkchild)1Embed"
