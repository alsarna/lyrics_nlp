LyricsWhich way you goin' Billy?\nCan I go too?\nWhich way you goin' Billy?\nCan I go with you?\n\nI really love you, Billy\nAnd all this time\nI thought you loved me, Billy\nAnd you were mine\n\nI'm gonna miss you, Billy\nAnd though I'm trying\nI'm hurting so bad, Billy\nI can't help crying\n\nYou are my whole, babe\nMy heart and my soul, babe\nI'd have nothing to show, babe\nIf you should go away\nYou are my whole, babe\nMy heart and my soul, babe\nI'd have nothing to show, babe\nIf you should go\n\nWhich way you going, Billy?\nOr need I ask?\nCause you don't want me, Billy\nYou're free at last\n\nI won't forget you, Billy\nFor all my life\nI'll always love you, Billy\nI'll stay your wife\n\nYou are my whole, babe\nMy heart and my soul, babe\nI'd have nothing to show, babe\nIf you should go away\n\nYou are my whole, babe\nMy heart and my soul, babe\nI'd have nothing to show, babe\nIf you should go\n\nYou are my whole, babe\nMy heart and my soul, babe\nI'd have nothing to show, babe\nIf you should go\nI won't forget you, Billy...Embed"
