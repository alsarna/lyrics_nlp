Ooooh\nBroken hearted melody\nMust you keep reminding me\nOf the lips I long to kiss\nAnd the love I miss since he went away\nNight and day they play\nThat broken hearted melody\nThat he used to sing to me\nWhen our love was young and bright\nAs he held me tight\nSuddenly I found, I was heaven bound\nBrooooken hearted melody\nOoooonce you were our song of love\nNooooow you just keep taunting me\nWiiiiiith the memory of (ba-da-da)\nHis tender love, Ooooh\nBroken hearted melody\nWon't you bring him back to me\nSing to him until he yearns\nFor when he returns no more will he be\nA broken hearted melody\nOooooooo, oo-oo\nOo-oo, oo-oo, ooooooooo\nOooooooo, oo-oo\nOo-oo, oo-oo, oooooooooEmbed"
