    "lyrics": "All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You LyricsIt was a rainy night\nWhen he came into sight\nStanding by the road\nWith no umbrella, no coat\n\nSo I pulled up along side\nAnd I offered him a ride\nHe accepted with a smile\nSo we drove for a while\n\nI didn't ask him his name\nThis lonely boy in the rain\nFate, tell me it's right\nIs this love at first sight?\nPlease don't make it wrong\nJust stay for a night\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nSay you will, you want me too\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nI got loving arms to hold onto\n\nSo we found this hotel\nIt was a place I knew well\nWe made magic that night\nOh, he did everything right\n\nHe brought the woman out of me\nSo many times, easily\nAnd in the morning, when he woke\nAll I left him was a note\n\nI told him I am the flower\nYou are the seed\nWe walked in the garden\nWe planted a tree\n\nDon't try to find me\nPlease don't you dare\nJust live in my memory\nYou'll always be there\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nI got loving arms to hold onto\nWhoa, oh, we made love\nLove like strangers\nAll night long\nWe made love\n\nThen it happened one day\nWe came 'round the same way\nYou can imagine his surprise\nWhen he saw his own eyes\n\nI said, \"Please, please understand\nI'm in love with another man\nAnd what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa\nWas the one little thing that you can\"\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nCome on, say you will, you want me too\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nSay you will, baby, want me too\n\nAll night long, all night long\nAll night long, all night long\nAll I wanna do, all I wanna do\nAll I wanna do, all I wanna do\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knewEmbed"
