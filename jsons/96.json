    "lyrics": "Refrain)\nI found my April dream in Portugal with you\nWhen we discovered romance, like we never knew\nMy head was in the clouds, My heart went crazy too\nAnd madly I said: \"I love you.\"\n(Interlude)\nToo soon I heard you say:\n\"This dream is for a day\"\nThat's Porugal and love in April!\nAnd when the showers fell\nThose tears I know so well\nThey told me it was spring fooling me\n(Refrain)\nI found my April dream in Portugal with you\nWhen we discovered romance, like I never knew\nThen morning brought the rain\nAnd now my dream is through\nBut still my heart says \"I love you.\"\n(Interlude)\nThis sad reality, To know it couldn't be\nThat's Portugal and love in April!\nThe music and the wine convinced me you were mine\nBut it was just the spring fooling me\n(Refrain)\nI found my April dream in Portugal with you\nWhen we discovered romance, like I never knew\nThen morning brought the rain\nAnd now my dream is through\nBut still my heart says \"I love you.\""
