(Ah) Hmm\nDo you get déjà vu, huh?\n[Verse 2]\nDo you call her, almost say my name?\n’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same\nAnother actress\nI hate to think that I was just your type\nAnd I bet that she knows Billy Joel\n’Cause you played her \"Uptown Girl\"\nYou're singin' it together\nNow I bet you even tell her how you love her\nIn between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?\nShe thinks it's special, but it’s all reused\nThat was the show we talked about\nPlayed you the songs she's singing now when she's with you\nDo you get déjà vu when she's with you?\nDo you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)\nDo you get déjà vu?\n[Bridge]\nStrawberry ice cream in Malibu\nDon't act like we didn't do that shit, too\nYou're tradin' jackets like we used to do\n(Yeah, everything is all reused)\nPlay her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)\nThat I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)\nA different girl now, but there's nothing new\n[Outro]\nI know you get déjà vu\nI know you get déjà vu\nI know you get déjà vu187Embed"
