(Whoa, oh)\nMy mind keeps saying, \"run as fast as you can\"\nI say, \"I'm done,\" but then you pull me back (Whoa, oh)\nI swear you're giving me a heart attack\nTroublemaker\nWhy does it feel so good, but hurt so bad? (Whoa, oh)\n(Hurt so bad, yeah)\nMy mind keeps saying, \"run as fast as you can\" (You troublemaker)\nI say, \"I'm done,\" but then you pull me back (Whoa, oh)\nI swear you're giving me a heart attack\nTroublemaker\n\n[Verse 3: Flo Rida]\nMaybe I'm insane\n'Cause I keep doing the same damn thing\nThinking one day we gon' change\nBut you know just how to work that back\nAnd make me forget my name\nWhat the hell you do, I won't remember\nI'll be gone until November\nAnd you'll show up again next summer, yeah!\nTypical middle name is Prada\nFit you like a glove, girl\nI'm sick of the drama\nYou're a troublemaker\nBut damn, girl, it's like I love the trouble\nAnd I can't even explain why\n[Chorus: Olly Murs]\nWhy does it feel so good but hurt so bad (Whoa, oh)\nMy mind keeps saying, \"run as fast as you can\" (Troublemaker)\nI say, \"I'm done,\" but then you pull me back (Whoa, oh)\nI swear you're giving me a heart attack\nTroublemaker\nWhy does it feel so good but hurt so bad\n(And I can't even explain why)\nMy mind keeps saying, \"run as fast as you can\" (Troublemaker)\nI say, \"I'm done,\" but then you pull me back (Whoa, oh)\nI swear you're giving me a heart attack\nTroublemaker"
