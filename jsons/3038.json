    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nI thought that dreams belonged to other men\nCause each time I got close\nThey'd fall apart again\nI feared my heart would beat in secrecy\n\nI faced the nights alone\nOh, how could I have known\nThat all my life\nI only needed you\n\n[Chorus:]\nOh\nAlmost paradise\nWe're knocking on heaven's door\nAlmost paradise\nHow could we ask for more?\n\nI swear that I can see\nForever in your eyes\nParadise\n\n[Verse 2:]\nIt seems like perfect\nLove's so hard to find\nI'd almost given up\nYou must've read my mind\nAnd all these dreams\nI saved for a rainy day\nThey're finally coming true\nI'll share them all with you\nCause now we hold the\nFuture in our hands\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Bridge:]\nAnd in your arms\nSalvation's not so far away\nWe're getting closer\nCloser every day\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\nParadise\nParadise"
