    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAs the snow flies\nOn a cold and gray Chicago morning\nA poor little baby child is born\nIn the ghetto\nAnd his mama cries\nCause if there's one thing that she don't need\nIt's another little hungry mouth to feed\nIn the ghetto\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople, don't you understand\nA child needs a helping hand\nOr he'll grow to be an angry young man some day\nTake a look at you and me\nAre we too blind to see\nDo we simply turn our heads\nAnd look the other way\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell the world turns\nAnd a hungry little boy with a runny nose\nPlays in the street as the cold wind blows\nIn the ghetto\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd his hunger burns\nSo he starts to roam the streets at night\nAnd he learns how to steal\nAnd he learns how to fight\nIn the ghetto\n[Verse 5]\nThen one night in desperation\nA young man breaks away\nHe buys a gun, He steals a car\nTries to run, but he don't get far\nAnd his mama cries\n\n[Bridge]\nAs a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man\nFace down on the street with a gun in his hand\nIn the ghetto\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd as her young man dies\nOn a cold and gray Chicago morning\nAnother little baby child is born\nIn the ghetto\n\nAnd his mama cries\nIn the ghetto"
