    "lyrics": "Here... close to our feeling... we touch again.... we love again\nRemember when we thought our hearts would never mend?\nAnd we're all the better for each other\nThere's more to love, I know...than making love\n\nHere... no more confusion\nWe see our lives, We live our lives\nRemember when we thought we never would survive?\nBut now neither one of us is breaking\nThere's more to love, I know...than making love\n\nSomethings never change\nSomethings sometimes do\n\nAnd now I'm feeling strong enough to let you in\nAnd now neither one of us is breaking\nKnowing now that there's more to love...than making love\nAnd I remember you.....and making love\n\nAnd I remember you...\nAnd I remember you...oooo\nAnd I remember you\nAnd I remember you...ooo"
