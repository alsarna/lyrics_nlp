    "lyrics": "Problems LyricsProblems, problems, problems all day long\nWill my problems work out right or wrong\nMy baby don't like anything I do\nMy teacher seems to feel the same way too\n\nWorries, worries pile up on my head\nWoe is me I should have stayed in bed\nCan't get the car my marks ain't been so good\nMy love life just ain't swingin' like it should\n\nProblems, problems, problems\nThey're all on account-a my lovin' you like I do\nProblems, problems, problems\nThey won't be solved until I'm sure of you\nYou can solve my problems with a love that's true\nProblems, problems, problems all day long\nProblems, problems, problems all day longEmbed"
