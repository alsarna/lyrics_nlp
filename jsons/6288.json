You made me a, you made me a\nBeliever, believer\nPain! You break me down and build me up\nBeliever, believer\nPain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain\nMy life, my love, my drive, it came from…\nPain! You made me a, you made me a\nBeliever, believer\n[Verse 3]\nThird things third\nSend a prayer to the ones up above\nAll the hate that you've heard\nHas turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh\nYour spirit up above, oh-ooh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was chokin' in the crowd\nBuilding my rain up in the cloud\nFalling like ashes to the ground\nHoping my feelings, they would drown\nBut they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'\nInhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down\nIt rained down, like…\n\n[Chorus]\nPain! You made me a, you made me a\nBeliever, believer\nPain! You break me down and build me up\nBeliever, believer\nPain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain\nMy life, my love, my drive, it came from…\nPain! You made me a, you made me a\nBeliever, believer\n[Verse 4]\nLast things last\nBy the grace of the fire and the flames\nYou're the face of the future\nThe blood in my veins, oh-ooh\nThe blood in my veins, oh-ooh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'\nInhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down\nIt rained down, like…\n\n[Chorus]\nPain! You made me a, you made me a\nBeliever, believer\nPain! You break me down and build me up\nBeliever, believer\nPain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain\nMy life, my love, my drive, it came from…\nPain! You made me a, you made me a\nBeliever, believer"
