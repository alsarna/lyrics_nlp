Bang! Bang!\nSo I got an apartment across from the park\nPut quinoa in my fridge\nStill, I'm not feeling grown\nBeen a hell of a ride\nBut I'm thinking it's time to go\nBang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo put your best face on everybody\nPretend you know this song everybody\nCome hang (Come hang)\nLet's go out with a bang!\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nI'm way too young to lie here forever\nI'm way too old to try so whatever\nCome hang\nLet's go out with a bang\nBang! Bang! Bang!\n[Verse 2]\nFeel like I'm gonna puke\n'Cause my taxes are due\nDo my password begin with a one or a two?\nBeen a hell of a ride\nBut I'm thinking it's time to grow\nBang! Bang! Bang! (Metronome!)\nMan, I'm up to somethin' (Up to somethin')\nOo-dee-la-dee-doe\nThank you all for comin' (All for comin')\nI hope you like the show\n'Cause it's on a budget (On a budget)\nSo ooh-dee-la-dee-doe\nYeah, come on here we go\nYeah, come on (Here we go!)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo put your best face on everybody\nPretend you know this song everybody\nCome hang\nLet's go out with a bang\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nI'm way too young to lie here forever\nI'm way too old to try, so whatever\nCome hang (Come hang)\nLet's go out with a bang\nBang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang)\nBang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang, bang)\n[Bridge]\nBeen a hell of a ride\nBut I'm thinking it's time to go\nSo put your best face on everybody\nPretend you know this song everybody\nCome hang\nLet's go out with a bang!\nBang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo put your best face on everybody\nPretend you know this song everybody\nCome hang\nLet's go out with a bang!\nI'm way too young to lie here forever\nI'm way too old to try so whatever\nCome hang (Come hang)\nLet's go out with a bang!\nBang! Bang! Bang!\n(Here we go!)\nBang! Bang!63Embed"
