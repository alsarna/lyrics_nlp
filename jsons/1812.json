Woo!\nMama!\nMa-ma-ma-ma, yeah!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI never knew, never knew how complete love could be\nTill she kissed me and said:\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Baby, please, go all the way\nIt feels so right being with you, here, tonight\nPlease, go all the way\nJust hold 'me close don't ever let me go\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI couldn't say what I wanted to say\nTill she whispered:\n\"I love you so\"\n[Chorus]\n\"Please, go all the way\nIt feels so right being with you, here, tonight\nPlease go all the way\nJust hold me close, don't ever let me go\"\n\n[Bridge]\nBefore her love I was cruel and mean\nI had a hole in the place where my heart should have been\nBut now I've changed and it feels so strange\nI come alive when she does all those things to me\nAnd she says:\n\"Come on, come on, come on\nI need you, I love you, I need you\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Baby, please, go all the way\nIt feels so right being with you, here, tonight\nPlease, go all the way\nJust hold me close don't ever let me go\"\n\n[Outro]\nOh no\nUuuh, uuh, uuhh\nOh no\nNo, no, no, nah, nah\nGo all the way, baby\nWoo-hoo-ooo!5Embed"
