Hello?\n'Course you're the only girl\nYou're all I think about\nYou're the only girl for me\nYou're all I think about\nYou're special\nYou know I love you\nYou know I love you\n\n[Michel'le]\nYou say you love me\nAnd I think that is true\nBut every night my girlfriend tells me\nI should watch you\nNow I say I trust you\nBut I want you to know\nI'm not a sucker;\nChill out-your nose is growing, Pinocchio\nSo now I'm leaving\nAnd you know I tried\nAll right, baby, no more lies\nDo-do-doo-ooh-ooh\nDo-do-doo-ooh-ooh\nDo-do-do-do-do-ooh-ooh\n\nYou say no more lies\nAnd I'll try to understand\nBut there's a little exaggeration\nIn almost every man\nNow I say I trust you\nBut I want you to know\nWant you to know\nSounds like you're cryin' wolf, babe-\nI think it's time for me to go\n\nSo now I'm leaving\nAnd you know I tried\nAll right, baby, no more lies\nBut you don't appreciate\nThe time I take\nAll right baby, no more lies\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nHello? You're the only girl for me\nNo more lies\nYou're all I think about;\n'Course you're the only girl;\nYou're special2Embed"
