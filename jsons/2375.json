    "lyrics": "Well, it's been building up inside of me\nFor, oh, I don't know how long\nI don't know why\nBut I keep thinkin'\nSomethings bound to go wrong\n\nBut she looks in my eyes\nAnd makes me realize\nWhen she says\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\n(Don't worry baby)\nEverything will turn out alright\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\n(Don't worry baby)\n(Baby)\n\nEach morning I awake and find\nThe sunlight softly shining in her hair\nAnd then I realize that I'm only\nThinkin' that she really doesn't care\nThere's magic in her eyes\nThat makes me come alive\nWhen she says\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\n(Don't worry baby)\nEverything will turn out alright\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\n\nShe told me Baby, when you leave today\nJust take along my love with you\nAnd if you knew how much I loved you\nBaby nothing could go wrong with you\nOh what she does to me\nWhen she makes love to me\nAnd she says\n\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\n(Don't worry baby)\nEverything will turn out alright\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\n(Don't worry baby)\nDon't worry baby\nEverything will turn out alright"
