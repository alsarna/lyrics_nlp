    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat goes up must come down\nSpinnin' wheel got to go 'round\nTalkin' 'bout your troubles it's a cryin' sin\nRide a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel spin\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got no money and you got no home\nSpinnin' wheel all alone\nTalkin' 'bout your troubles and you never learn\nRide a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel turn\n\n[Bridge]\nDid you find the directing sign on the\nStraight and narrow highway\nWould you mind a reflecting sign\nJust let it shine within your mind\nAnd show you the colors that are real\n\n[Verse 3]\nSomeone is waiting just for you\nSpinnin' wheel, spinnin' true\nDrop all your troubles by the riverside\nCatch a painted pony on the spinning wheel ride\n\n[Instrumental]\n[Verse 4]\nSomeone is waiting just for you\nSpinnin' wheel, spinnin' true\nDrop all your troubles by the riverside\nRide a painted pony let the spinning wheel fly\n[Outro]"
