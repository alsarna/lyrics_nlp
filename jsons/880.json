    "lyrics": "There's a crazy little shack beyond the tracks\nAnd everybody calls it the Sugar Shack\nWell, it's just a coffeehouse and it's made out of wood\nExpresso coffee tastes mighty good\nThat's not the reason why I've got to get back\nTo that sugar shack, whoa baby\nTo that sugar shack\n\nThere's this cute little girlie, she's a-working there\nA black leotard and her feet are bare\nI'm gonna drink a lot of coffee, spend a little cash\nMake that girl love me when I put on some trash\nYou can understand why I've got to get back\nTo that sugar shack\nWhoa baby, to that sugar shack\nYeah honey, to that sugar shack\nWhoa yes, to that sugar shack\n\nNow that sugar shack queen is a-married to me, yeah yeah\nWe just sit around and dream of those old memories\nAh, but one of these days I'm gonna lay down tracks\nIn the direction of that sugar shack\nJust me and her, yes, we're gonna go back\nTo that sugar shack\nWhoa uh oh\nTo that sugar shack\nYeah honey, to our sugar shack\nYea, yea, yea, our sugar shack"
