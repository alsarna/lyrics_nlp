Ya ever seem to have one of those days\nWhere it just seems like everybody's gettin' on your case?\nFrom your teacher all the way down to your best girlfriend?\nWell, ya know, I used to have 'em just about all the time\nBut I found a way to get out of 'em\nLet me tell you about it\n\nSitting in the classroom, thinking it's a drag\nListening to the teacher rap, just ain't my bag\nThe noon bells rings, you know that's my cue\nI'm gonna meet the boys on floor number two!\n\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nNow, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules\nBut everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school\nCheckin' out the halls, makin' sure the coast is clear\nLookin' in the stalls, \"No, there ain't nobody here!\"\nOh, my buddy Fang, and me and Paul\nTo get caught would surely be the death of us all\n\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nNow, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules\nBut everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school\nAll right!\n\n[Instrumental]\n\nOh, put me to work, in the school book store\nCheck out counter and I got bored\nTeacher was lookin' for me all around\nTwo hours later, you know where I was found\n\nSmokin' in the boys' room (Yes indeed, I was)\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nNow, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules\nBut everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school\n\nOne mo'!\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nOh, smokin' in the boys' room\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nSmokin' in the boys' room\nNow, teacher, I am fully aware of the rules\nAnd everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school"
