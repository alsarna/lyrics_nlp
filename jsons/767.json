    "lyrics": "San Antonio Rose Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]\n\nDeep within my heart lies a melody\nA song of old San Antone\nWhere in dreams I live with a memory\nBeneath the stars, all alone\n\nWell it was there I found, beside the Alamo\nEnchantments strange as the blue up above\nFor that moonlit pass, that only he would know\nStill hears my broken song of love\n\nMoon in all your splendor, known only to my heart\nCall back my rose, rose of San Antone\nLips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart\nSpeak once again of my love, my own\nBroken song, empty words I know\nStill live in my heart all alone\nFor that moonlit pass by the Alamo\nAnd rose, my rose of San Antone\nBroken song, empty words I know\nStill live in my heart all alone\n\nFor that moonlit pass by the Alamo\nAnd rose, my rose of San Antone\nAnd rose, my rose of San Antone\nAnd rose, my rose of San AntoneEmbed"
