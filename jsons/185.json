    "lyrics": "THE POOR PEOPLE OF PARIS LyricsJust got back from Paris, France\nAll they do is sing and dance\nAll they've got there is romance\nWhat a tragedy\nEvery boulevard has lovers\nEvery lover's in a trance\nThe poor people of Paree\nI feel sorry for the French\nEvery guy has got a wench\nEvery couple's got a bench\nKissing shamelessly\nNight and day they're making music\nWhile they're making love in French\nThe poor people of Paree\nMilk or water from the sink\nMake a true Parisian shrink\nWine is all he'll ever drink\nAnd it worries me\nFor with wine as cheap as water\nOh, it makes one stop and think\nThe poor people of Paree\nSister met a boy named Pierre\nHad the craziest affair\nAnd the day they parted there\nHe cried bitterly\nPierre was there to bid her farewell\nBut he brought his new girl, Claire\nThe poor people of Paree\nSo don't go to Paris, France\nNot unless you like to dance\nNot unless you want romance\nLike those poor inhabitants of PareeEmbed"
