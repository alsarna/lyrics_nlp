My whole darn family's here\"\n(We gotta have a home, gotta have a home)\n\nThe farmer said to the boll weevil \"Say, why do you pick my farm?\"\nThe weevil just laughed at the farmer 'n' said\n\"We ain't gonna do ya much harm\"\n(\"We're looking for a home\")\n\nAnd the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug\nHe said \"Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you\nBut, ya see if I was a lightning bug, I'd search the whole night through\"\n(\"Searchin' for a home, I'd have me plenty of home\")\n\nAnd the boll weevil called the farmer, 'n' he said\n\"Ya better sell your old machines\n'Cause when I'm through with your cotton, heh\nYou can't even buy gasoline.\"\n(I'm gonna stake me a home, gotta have a home)\nAnd the boll weevil said to the farmer, said\n\"Farmer, I'd like to wish you well.\"\nFarmer said to the boll weevil, \"Yeah, an' I wish that you were in shit\"\n(Lookin' for a home, lookin' for a home)\n(Ahh, you have a home all right, you have a home)\n(A real hot home, ahh)"
