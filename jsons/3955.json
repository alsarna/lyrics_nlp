    "lyrics": "The road I have traveled on\nIs paved with good intentions\nIt's littered with broken dreams\nThat never quite came true\n\nWhen all of my hopes were dying\nHer love kept me trying\nShe does her best to hide\nThe pain that she's been through\n\n(CHORUS)\nWhen she cries at night\nAnd she doesn't think that I can hear her\nShe tries to hide\nAll the fears she feels inside\nSo I pray this time\nI can be the man that she deserves\n'Cause I die a little each time\nWhen she cries\n\nShe's always been there for me\nWhenever I've fallen\nWhen nobody else believes\nShe'll be there by my side\n\nI don't know how she takes it\nJust once I'd like to make it\nThen there'll be tears of joy\nThat fill her loving eyes\n(CHORUS)\nSo I pray this time\nI can be the man that she deserves\n'Cause I die a little each time\nWhen she cries"
