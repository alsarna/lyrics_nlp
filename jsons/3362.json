    "lyrics": "Love can make you weep\nCan make you run for cover\nRoots that spread so deep\nBring life to frozen ground\n\nSomething so strong\nCould carry us away\nSomething so strong\nCould carry us today\n\nTurning in my sleep\nLove can leave you cold\nA taste of jealousy\nIs like a lust for gold\n\nSomething so strong\nCould carry us away\nSomething so strong\nCould carry us today\n\nI've been\nFeeling so much older\nFrame me\nAnd hang me on the wall\nI've seen\nYou fall into the same trap\nThis thing\nIs happening to us all\nSomething so strong\nCould carry us away\nSomething so strong\nCould carry us today\n\nSomething so strong\nSomething so strong\nSomething so strong\nSomething, something so strong"
