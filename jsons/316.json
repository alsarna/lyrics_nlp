    "lyrics": "Marianne, Oh, Marianne, Oh won't you marry me?\nWe can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea\nLeave your fat old Nanna home\nShe never will say yes\nIf mamma don't know now\nShe can guess, my, my, yes\n\nAll night, all day, Marianne\nDown by the seaside sifting sand\nEven little children love Marianne\nDown by the seaside sifting sand\n\nWhen she walks along the shore\nPeople pause to greet\nWhile birds fly around her\nLittle fish come to her feet\nIn her heart is love, but I'm the only mortal man\nWho's allowed to kiss my Marianne\nDon't rush me\n\nAll night, all day, Marianne\nDown by the seaside sifting sand\nEven little children love Marianne\nDown by the seaside sifting sand\n\nWhen we marry, we will have\nA time you never saw\nI will be so happy\nI will kiss my mother-in-law\nChildren by the dozen, in and out the bamboo hut\nOne for every palm tree, and cok-y-nut, Hurry up now\nAll night, all day, Marianne\nDown by the seaside sifting sand\nEven little children love Marianne\nDown by the seaside sifting sand"
