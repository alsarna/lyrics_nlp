    "lyrics": "I love you, so much\nSomewhere back in time\nYou became a friend of mine\nAnd day by day we've grown a little closer\nYou're my spirit to be strong\nA friend when things go wrong\nSo I've written down these words to let you know\n\nLoves grown deep, deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\nLet us plant the seed and watch it grow\nLoves grown deep, deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\n\nAs we travel down the road\nSide-by-side we'll share the load\nHand-in-hand we'll see each other through\nThough we've only just begun\nLet's count our blessings one-by-one\nI thank God for life, I thank God for you\n\nLoves grown deep, deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\nLet us plant the seed and watch it grow\nLoves grown deep, deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\nAnd as the seasons slip away\nForever lovers we will stay\nTogether, do-or-die, with all our hearts\n\nLoves grown deep, deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\nLet us plant the seed and watch it grow\nLoves grown deep, deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me"
