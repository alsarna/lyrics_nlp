    "lyrics": "The falling leaves drift by the window\nThe autumn leaves of red and gold\nI see your lips, the summer kisses\nThe sunburned hand I used to hold\n\nSince you went away the days grow long\nAnd soon I'll hear old winter's song\nBut I miss you most of all, my darling\nWhen autumn leaves start to fall\n\nI see your lips, the summer kisses\nThe sunburned hand I used to hold\n\nSince you went away the days grow long\nAnd soon I'll hear old winter's song\nBut I miss you most of all, my darling\nWhen autumn leaves start to fall"
