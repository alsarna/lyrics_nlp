(ooh)\nJet! (ooh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nJet, was your father as bold as a Sergeant Major?\nOh, how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd Jet, I thought the Major was a Lady Suffragette\n\n[Chorus]\nJet! (ooh)\nJet! (ooh)\n[Bridge]\nAh, mater, want Jet to always love me\nAh, mater, want Jet to always love me\nAh, mater, much later\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\nJet!\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd Jet, I thought the Major was a little Lady Suffragette\n\n[Chorus]\nJet! (ooh)\nJet! (ooh)\n\n[Bridge]\nAh, mater, want Jet to always love me\nAh, mater, want Jet to always love me\nAh, mater, much later\n\n[Verse 3]\nJet, with the wind in your hair of a thousand laces\nClimb on the back, and we'll go for a ride in the sky\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd Jet, I thought that the Major was a little Lady Suffragette\n[Chorus]\nJet! (ooh)\nJet! (ooh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nAnd Jet, you know I thought you was a little Lady Suffragette\n\n[Outro]\nJet! (ooh)\nA little lady\nMy little lady, yes, oh"
