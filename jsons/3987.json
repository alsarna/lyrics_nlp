I won't break\nI'll be the rock you can build on\nBe there when you're old\nTo have and to hold\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen there's love inside\nI swear I'll always be strong\nThen there's a reason why\nI'll prove to you we belong\nI'll be the wall that protects you (Yeah)\nFrom the wind and the rain\nFrom the hurt and the pain\nYeah (Hey)\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's make it, all for one and all for love\nLet the one you hold be the one you want\nThe one you need\n'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all\nWhen there's someone that should know\nThen just let your feelings show\nAnd make it all for one and all for love\n[Verse 3]\nWhen it's love you make\nI'll be the fire in your night\nThen it's love you take\nI will defend, I will fight\nI'll be there when you need me\nWhen honor's at stake\nThis vow I will make, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nThat it's all for one and all for love\nLet the one be the one you want\nThe one you need\n'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all\nWhen there's someone that should know\nThen just let your feelings show\nAnd make it all for one and all for love\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't lay our love to rest\n'Cause we could stand up to you test\nWe got everything and more than we had planned\nMore than the rivers that run the land\nWe've got it all in our hands\n\n[Chorus]\nNow it's all for one and all for love\nLet the one you hold be the one you want\nThe one you need\n'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all\nWhen there's someone that should know\nThen just let your feelings show\nWhen there's someone that you want\nWhen there's someone that you need\nLet's make it all, all for one and all for love"
