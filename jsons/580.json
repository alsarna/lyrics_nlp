    "lyrics": "Theme From A Summer Place LyricsThere's a summer place\nWhere it may rain or storm\nYet I'm safe and warm\nFor within that summer place\nYour arms reach out to me\nAnd my heart is free from all care\nFor it knows\n\nThere are no gloomy skies\nWhen seen through the eyes\nOf those who are blessed with love\n\nAnd the sweet secret of\nA summer place\nIs that it's anywhere\nWhen two people share\nAll their hopes\nAll their dreams\nAll their love\nAnd the sweet secret of a summer place\nIs that it's anywhere\nWhen two people share\nAll their hopes\nAll their dreams, all their love1Embed"
