    "lyrics": "Listen to Your Heart (Extended Hardstyle Mix) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI know there's something in the wake of your smile\nI get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah\nYou've built a love, but that love falls apart\nYour little piece of heaven turns too dark\n\n[Drop]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile\nThe precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah\nThey're swept away and nothing is what it seems\nThe feeling of belonging to your dreams\n\n[Drop]Embed"
