(Oh!)\nFreedom!\n(My) Freedom!\nYou got to give what you take!\nFreedom!\nI'll hold on to my (Freedom!)\nMy (Freedom!)\nYou got to give what you take! (You got to give what, to give what, to give what you take!)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah!\nYou got to give what, to give what, to give\nMay not be what you want from me\nJust the way it's got to be\nLose the face now\nI've got to live6Embed"
