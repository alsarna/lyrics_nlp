    "lyrics": "Here in my heart I'm alone, I'm so lonely\nHere in my heart I just yearn for you only\nHere in my arms I long to hold you\nHold you so near, ever close to my heart\n\nSo, darling\nSay that you care, take these arms I give gladly\nSurely you know I need your love so badly\nHere is my heart, my life and my all, dear\nPlease be mine and stay here in my heart\n\nSay that you care, take these arms I give gladly\nSurely you know I need your love so badly\nHere is my heart, my life and my all, dear\nPlease be mine and stay here in my heart"
