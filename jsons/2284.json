    "lyrics": "ANGEL IN YOUR ARMS\n\nDo you think I'm such a fool to believe everything you say is true\nThat just goes to show\nThat you really don't know\n\nWhile you're out paintin' the town\nDo you think I'm home just sittin' around waitin' on you\nNow who's really the fool\n\nWhen I first found out I hurt all over\nI felt so left out 'til I got to know her\nSo I tried the way that she got over\nAnd I became just like her\nSo don't be surprised to find\n\nThat the angel in your arms this morning\nIs gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight\nYes, The angel in your arms this morning\nIs gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight\n\nWhy'd you slip around secretly\nIf you were tired of loving me\nWhy'd you keep holdin' on when love was already gone\n\nThe times you said you weren't feelin' well\nDid you think I couldn't tell you'd been with someone else\nYou were only kiddin' yourself\nWhen I first found out I hurt all over\nI felt so left out 'til I got to know her\nSo I tried the way that she got over\nAnd I became just like her\nSo don't be surprised to find\n\nThat the angel in your arms this morning\nIs gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight\nYes the angel in your arms this morning\nIs gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight\n\nYes the angel in your arms this morning\nIs gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight\nThe angel in your arms this morning\nIs gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight"
