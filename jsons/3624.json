Shay plays on the fade\nSlice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade\nSo fast, other DJs say, “Damn!”\nIf rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram\nKeep my composure when it's time to get loose\nMagnetized by the mic while I kick my juice\nIf there was a problem yo I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\n[Chorus]\nIce ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nIce ice, baby\nVanilla Ice\n[Outro]\nYo man, let's get out of here\nWord to your mother\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)\nIce"
