    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou're the kind of person\nYou meet at certain dismal dull affairs\nCenter of a crowd, talking much too loud\nRunning up and down the stairs\nWell, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years\nAnd though you've tried you just can't hide\nYour eyes are edged with tears\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou better stop\nLook around\nHere it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you were a child\nYou were treated kind\nBut you were never brought up right\nYou were always spoiled with a thousand toys\nBut still you cried all night\nYour mother who neglected you\nOwes a million dollars tax\nAnd your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou better stop\nLook around\nHere it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane\nWell nothing I do don't seem to work\nIt only seems to make matters worse. Oh please\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou were still in school\nWhen you had that fool\nWho really messed your mind\nAnd after that you turned your back\nOn treating people kind\nOn our first trip\nI tried so hard to rearrange your mind\nBut after while I realized you were disarranging mine\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou better stop\nLook around\nHere it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane\nWell nothing I do don't seem to work\nIt only seems to make matters worse. Oh please\nWhen you were a child\nYou were treated kind\nBut you were never brought up right\nYou were always spoiled with a thousand toys\nBut still you cried all night\nYour mother who neglected you\nOwes a million dollars tax\nAnd your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax\nYou better stop\nLook around\n\n[Outro]\nHere comes\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown"
