That girl's just insane\nWell, nothing I do don't seem to work\nIt only seems to make matters worse, oh, please\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou were still in school when you had that fool\nWho really messed your mind\nAnd after that, you turned your back\nOn treating people kind\nOn our first trip, I tried so hard\nTo rearrange your mind\nBut after while, I realized\nYou were disarranging mine\n[Chorus]\nYou better stop\nLook around\nHere it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, who's to blame? That girl's just insane\nWell, nothing I do don't seem to work\nIt only seems to make matters worse, oh, please\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you were a child, you were treated kind\nBut you were never brought up right\nYou were always spoiled with a thousand toys\nBut still you cried all night\nYour mother who neglected you\nOwes a million dollars tax\nAnd your father's still perfecting ways\nOf making sealing wax\n\n[Outro]\nYou better stop\nLook around\nHere it comes\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown\nHere comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown3Embed"
