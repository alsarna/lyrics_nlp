    "lyrics": "Love Letters LyricsLove letters straight from your heart\nKeep us so near while apart\nI'm not alone in the night\nWhen I can have all the love you write\n\nI memorize every line\nAnd I kiss the name that you sign\nAnd, darling, then I read again right from the start\nLove letters straight from your heart\n\nI memorize every line\nAnd I kiss the name that you sign\nAnd, darlin', then I read again right from the start\nLove letters straight from your heartEmbed"
