(My life)\n\n[Chorus]\nI get like this every time\nOn these days that feel like you and me\nHeartbreak anniversary\n'Cause I remember every time\nOn these days that feel like you and me\nHeartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?\n(Oh-ooh) Of me\n(Ooh) 'Cause I think of you, think of you\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)94Embed"
