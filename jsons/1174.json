    "lyrics": "Treat Her Right LyricsI wanna tell you a story\nEvery man oughta know\nIf you want a little lovin'\nYou gotta start real slow\nShe's gonna love you tonight now\nIf you just treat her right now\nSqueeze her real gentle\nGotta make her feel good\nTell her that you love her\nLike you know you should\nSo if you don't treat her right\nShe won't love you tonight\nIf you practice my method\nJust as hard as you can\nYou're gonna get a reputation\nAs a lovin' man\nAnd you'll be glad every night\nThat you treated her right\n(Music to fade)Embed"
