    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm glad you're home\nNow did you really miss me\nI guess you did by the look in your eyes\n(look in your eyes, look in your eyes)\nWell lay back and relax while I put away the dishes\n(put away the dishes)\nThen you and me can rock-a-bye\n\n[Hook]\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe night is young, and full of possibilities\nWell come on, and let yourself be free\nMy love for you, so long I've been saving\nTonight was made for me and you\n\n[Hook]\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\n[Bridge]\nYou can ring my bell, you can ring my bell\nDing dong, ding dong, ring it\nYou can ring my bell, anytime, anyway\nRing it, ring it ring it, owww\n\n[Hook]\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell\nYou can ring my bell, ring my bell"
