    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe was drivin' last Friday on the way to Cincinnati\nOn a snow-white Christmas Eve\nGoin' home to see her mama and her daddy\nWith the baby in the backseat\nFifty miles to go and she was runnin' low\nOn faith and gasoline\nIt'd been a long hard year\nShe had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention\nShe was goin' way too fast\nBefore she knew it\nShe was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass\nShe saw both their lives flash before her eyes\nShe didn't even have time to cry\nShe was so scared\nShe threw her hands up in the air\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Jesus, take the wheel\nTake it from my hands\n'Cause I can't do this on my own\nI'm letting go\nSo give me one more chance\nSave me from this road I'm on\nJesus, take the wheel\"\n[Verse 2]\nIt was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder\nAnd the car came to a stop\nShe cried when she saw that baby in the backseat\nSleepin' like a rock\nAnd for the first time in a long time\nShe bowed her head to pray\nShe said, \"I'm sorry for the way\nI've been livin' my life\nI know I've got to change\nSo from now on tonight\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Jesus, take the wheel\nTake it from my hands\n'Cause I can't do this on my own\nI'm letting go\nSo give me one more chance\nSave me from this road I'm on\nOh, Jesus, take the wheel\"\n\"Oh, I'm letting go\nSo give me one more chance\nSave me from this road I'm on\nFrom this road I'm on\nJesus, take the wheel\nOh, take it, take it from me\"\n[Outro]\nOh, woah, ooh"
