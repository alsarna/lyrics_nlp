    "lyrics": "Rescue me from the mire\nWhisper words of desire\nRescue me - darling rescue me\nWith your arms open wide\nWant you here by my side\nCome to me - darling rescue me\nWhen this world's closing in\nThere's no need to pretend\nSet me free - darling rescue me\n\nI don't wanna let you go\nSo I'm standing in your way\nI never needed anyone like I'm needing you today\n\nDo I have to say the words?\nDo I have to tell the truth?\nDo I have to shout it out?\nDo I have to say a prayer?\nMust I prove to you how good we are together?\nDo I have to say the words\n\nRescue me from despair\nTell me you will be there\nHelp me please- darlin rescue me\n\nEvery dream that we share\nEvery cross that we bear\nCan't you see- darling rescue me"
