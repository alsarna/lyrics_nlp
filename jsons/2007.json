    "lyrics": "I can see her lyin' back\nIn her satin dress\nIn a room where you do\nWhat you don't confess\nSundown you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round\nMy back stairs\nSundown you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round\nMy back stairs\n\nShe's been lookin' like a queen\nIn a sailor's dream\nAnd she don't always say\nWhat she really means\n\nSometimes I think it's a shame\nWhen I get feelin' better\nWhen I'm feelin' no pain\nSometimes I think it's a shame\nWhen I get feelin' better\nWhen I'm feelin' no pain\nI can picture every move\nThat a man could make\nGetting lost in her lovin'\nIs your first mistake\nSundown you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round\nMy back stairs\nSometimes I think it's a sin\nWhen I feel like I'm winnin'\nWhen I'm losin' again\nI can see her lookin' fast\nIn her faded jeans\nShe's a hard lovin' woman\nGot me feelin' mean\nSometimes I think it's a shame\nWhen I get feelin' better\nWhen I'm feelin' no pain\nSundown you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round\nMy back stairs\nSundown you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round\nMy back stairs\nSometimes I think it's a sin\nWhen I feel like I'm winnin'\nWhen I'm losin' again"
