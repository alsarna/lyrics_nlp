(Mama didn't lie.)\nShe didn't lie\n\nThe greatest pastime in this man's world\nIs playin' tricks on every young girl\nTo have one is how they get their kick\nBut not me because I know their trick\nAnd they're wrong to think I\nWill be caught by the wink of an eye\n\nMy mama didn't lie. (Mama didn't lie.)\nShe didn't lie\nMama didn't lie, she didn't lie\n\nI remember what my mama told me:\nShe said, \"Girl stay in your class\nYou got a whole lot of growin' and a'learnin' to do\nGirl don't cha go so fast\nThe greatest pastime in this man's world\nIs playin' tricks on every young girl\nTo have one is how they get their kick\nBut no me because I know their trick\nAnd they're wrong to think I\nWill be caught by the wink of an eye\n\nMy mama didn't lie. (Mama didn't lie)\nShe didn't lie\nMama didn't lie, she didn't lie\nMama didn't"
