Drake (Devvon Terrell Cover) Lyrics[Intro: Devvon Terrell]\nMy name is Devvon Terrell\nThis is a raw session\nYou know the vibes\n\n[Verse: Devvon Terrell]\nTrips that you plan for the next whole week\nBands too long for a nigga so cheap\nAnd your flex OD, and your sex OD\nYou got it, girl, you got it (Oh)\nOh lemme tell you\nYou got it, girl, you got it\nYou should deal with a five star nigga\nKnow you work more than just 6 figures\nI'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger\nI know you got a roster just full of hittas\nBut you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers\nBeen through so much shit that you don't even know the difference\nMade so many mental notes that you can't save a picture\nGot so many cuts and bruises I was still invested\nStill treat you like the best like KD to the Nets\n[Bridge: Devvon Terrell]\nI see you and I know you legit (Yeah)\nHigh off you, I need a fix (Yeah)\nYou a hot girl I'm off this lukewarm\nThat's like comparing you to a groupon chile\n\n[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]\nYou got it, girl, you got it (Aye)\nYou got it, girl, you got itEmbed"
