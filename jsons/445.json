    "lyrics": "Are you sincere when you say \"I love you?\"\nAre you sincere when you say \"I'll be true?\"\nDo you mean every word that my ears have heard?\nI'd like to know which way to go, will our love grow?\nAre you sincere? (Are you sincere?)\n\nAre you sincere when you say you miss me? (You miss me)\nAre you sincere every time you kiss me? (You kiss me)\nAnd are you really mine, every day, all the time?\nI'd like to know which way to go, will our love grow?\nAre you sincere? (Are you sincere?)\n\nAre really mine every day, all the time?\nI'd like to know (I'd like to know)\nWhich way to go (Which way to go)\nWill our love grow ? (Will our love grow?)\nAre you sincere?"
