    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nAs I watch you move\nAcross the moon-lit room\nThere's so much tenderness in your loving\n\nTomorrow, I must leave\nThe dawn knows no reprieve\nGod give me strength when I am leaving\n\n[Hook:]\nSo raise your hands to heaven\nAnd pray\nThat we'll be back together someday\n\n[Chorus:]\nTonight\nI need your sweet caress\nHold me in the darkness\nTonight\nYou calm my restlessness\nYou relieve my sadness\n\n[Verse 2:]\nAs we move to embrace\nTears run down your face\nI whisper words of love so softly\nI can't believe this pain\nIt's driving me insane\nWithout your touch\nLife will be lonely\n\n[Repeat Hook:]\n\n[Repeat Chorus x2:]\n\n[Bridge:]\nMorning has come\nAnother day\nI must pack my bags\nAnd say goodbye\nGoodbye\n\n[Repeat Chorus x2:]"
