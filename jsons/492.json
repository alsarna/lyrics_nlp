    "lyrics": "The night was clear\nAnd the moon was yellow\nAnd the leaves came tumbling down\n\nI was standing on the corner\nWhen I heard my bulldog bark\nHe was barking at the two men\nWho were gambling in the dark\n\nIt was Stagger Lee and Billy\nTwo men who gambled late\nStagger Lee threw seven\nBilly swore that he threw eight\n\nStagger Lee told Billy\n\"I can't let you go with that\nYou have won all my money\nAnd my brand new Stetson hat.\"\n\nStagger Lee started off\nGoin down that railroad track\nHe said, I can't get you Billy\nBut don't be here when I come back\n\nGo on, Stagger Lee\nStagger Lee went home\nAnd he got his .44\nSaid, \"I'm going to the bar room\nJust to pay that debt I owe.\"\n\nStagger Lee went to the bar room\nAnd he stood across the bar room door\nSaid, \"Now nobody move.\"\nAnd he pulled his .44\n\n\"Stagger Lee,\" cried Billy\n\"Oh, please don't take my life\nI got three little children\nAnd a very sickly wife.\"\n\nStagger Lee shot Billy\nOh he shot that poor boy so bad\nTill the bullet came through Billy\nAnd it broke the bartender's glass\n\nNow look out, Stagg, come on"
