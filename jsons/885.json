    "lyrics": "(Blue velvet)\n\nShe wore blue velvet\nBluer than velvet was the night\nSofter than satin was the light\nFrom the stars\n\nShe wore blue velvet\nBluer than velvet were her eyes\nWarmer than May, her tender sighs\nLove was ours\n\nOurs, a love I held tightly\nFeeling the rapture grow\nLike a flame burning brightly\nBut when she left gone was the glow of\n\nBlue velvet\nBut in my heart there'll always be\nPrecious and warm a memory through the years\nAnd I still can see blue velvet through my tears\n\nShe wore blue velvet\nBut in my heart there'll always be\nPrecious and warm a memory through the years\nAnd I still can see blue velvet through my tears\n(Blue velvet, ooh)"
