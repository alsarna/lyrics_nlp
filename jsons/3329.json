Lyrics[Verse 1: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]\nTake me as I am\nPut your hand in mine now and forever (Forever)\nDarling here I stand, stand before you now\nDeep inside I always knew\nIt was you, you and me\nTwo hearts drawn together bound by destiny\nIt was you and you for me\nEvery road leads to your door\nEvery step I take forever more\n\n[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera]\nJust say you'll love me for the rest of your life\nI got a lot of love and I don't want to let go\nWill you still love me for the rest of my life?\nBecause I can't go on\nNo, I can't go on\nI can't go on\nIf I'm on my own (My own)\n[Verse 2: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]\nTake me as I am\nPut your heart in mine, stay with me forever\nBecause I am just a man who never understood\nI never had a thing to prove\nThere was you\nYou and me\nThen it all came clear so suddenly\nHow close to you that I wanna be\n\n[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera]\nJust say you'll love me for the rest of your life\nI got a lot of love and I don't want to let go\nWill you still love me for the rest of my life?\nBecause I can't go on\nNo, I can't go on (Go on)\nI can't go on (Can't go on)\nIf I'm on my own\n\n[Verse 3: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]\nDo you believe a love could run so strong?\nDo you believe a love could pass you by?\nThere was no special one for me\nI was the lonely one, you see\nBut then my heart lost all control\nNow you're all that I know\n[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera]\nJust say you'll love me for the rest of your life\nI got a lot of love and I don't want to let go\nWill you still love me for the rest of my life?\nBecause I can't go on\nNo, I can't go on (Go on)\nI can't go on\nIf I'm on my own\nI can't go on\nNo, I can't go on (Go on)\n\n[Outro: Bill Champlin, (Peter Cetera)]\nBecause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)\nNo, I can't go on\nNo, I can't go on (Just say you love me)\nI can't go on without somebody I can count on\nBecause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)\nNo, I can't go on (Just say you love me)\nStay around, and never be alone\nBecause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)\nNo, I can't go on\nNo, I can't go on (Just say you love me)\nI can't go on without somebody I can count on\nBecause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)\nNo, I can't go on (Just say you love me)\nStay around, and never be aloneEmbed"
