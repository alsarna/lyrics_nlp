Mmm\nThat's gold, show me some respect (Oh-ah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thank God every day (Uh-huh)\nThat I woke up feelin' this way (Uh-huh)\nAnd I can't help lovin' myself\nAnd I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was you, I'd wanna be me too\nI'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too\nIf I was you, I'd wanna be me too\nI'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too\n[Verse 2]\nI walk in like a dime piece\nI go straight to VIP\nI never pay for my drinks\nMy entourage behind me\nMy life's a movie, Tom Cruise\nSo bless me, baby, achoo\nAnd even if they tried to\nThey can't do it like I do\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thank God every day (Thank God) (Uh-huh)\nThat I woke up feelin' this way (And I feel good) (Uh-huh)\nAnd I can't help lovin' myself (Woo)\nAnd I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh (No, no, baby)\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was you, I'd wanna be me too\nI'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too (Oh)\nIf I was you (I would wanna), I'd wanna be me too\nI'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too (Hey, hey)\n\n[Bridge]\nOw!
