(Hero)\nYou need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero\nWho on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)\nMy heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle\nMass destruction and mass corruption\nThe souls of sufferin' men\nClutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'\nIt's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good\nThen that's what it gotta be\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWho gon' pray for me?\nTake my pain for me?\nSave my soul for me?\n'Cause I'm alone, you see\nIf I'm gon' die for you\nIf I'm gon' kill for you\nThen I spilled this blood for you, hey\n\n[Bridge: The Weeknd]\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nHey, hey, hey, hey\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWho gon' pray for me?\nTake my pain for me?\nSave my soul for me?\n'Cause I'm alone, you see\nIf I'm gon' die for you\nIf I'm gon' kill for you\nThen I spilled this blood for you, hey\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & The Weeknd]\nJust in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law\nI'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own\nJust in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law\nI'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own"
