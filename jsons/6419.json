(Who gon' pray for me?)\nTake my pain for me? (Take my pain for me?)\nSave my soul for me? (Save my soul for me?)\n'Cause I'm alone, you see ('Cause I'm alone, you see)\nIf I'm gon' die for you (If I'm gon' die for you)\nIf I'm gon' kill for you (If I'm gon' kill for you)\nThen I spilled this blood\nFor you, hey\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself\nI fight God, just tell me how many burdens left\nI fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept\nI'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps\nLife a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets\nShooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief\nEarthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks\nThe poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface\nWho need a hero? (Hero)\nYou need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero\nWho on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)\nMy heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle\nMass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men\nClutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'\nIt's all prophecy and if I gotta be\nSacrificed for the greater good then that's what it gotta be\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWho gon' pray for me? (Who gon' pray for me?)\nTake my pain for me? (Take my pain for me?)\nSave my soul for me? (Save my soul for me?)\n'Cause I'm alone, you see ('Cause I'm alone, you see)\nIf I'm gon' die for you (If I'm gon' die for you)\nIf I'm gon' kill for you (If I'm gon' kill for you)\nThen I spilled this blood\nFor you, hey\n[Bridge: The Weeknd]\nHey, hey\nHey, hey\nHey, hey\nHey, hey\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWho gon' pray for me? (Who gon' pray for me?)\nTake my pain for me? (Take my pain for me?)\nSave my soul for me? (Save my soul for me?)\n'Cause I'm alone, you see ('Cause I'm alone, you see)\nIf I'm gon' die for you (If I'm gon' die for you)\nIf I'm gon' kill for you (If I'm gon' kill for you)\nThen I spilled this blood\nFor you, hey\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & The Weeknd]\nJust in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law\nI'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own\nJust in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law\nI'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own137Embed"
