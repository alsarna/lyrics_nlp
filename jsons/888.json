    "lyrics": "From Cape Cod Light to the Mississip', to San Francisco Bay\nThey're talkin' 'bout this famous place, down Greenwich Village way\nThey hootenanny all the time with folks from everywhere\nCome Sunday morning, rain or shine, right in Washington Square\nAn' so I got my banjo out, jes' sittin', catchin' dust\nAn' painted right across the case: \"Greenwich Village or Bust!\"\nMy folks were sad to see me go, but I got no meanin' there\nSo I said, \"Goodbye, Kansas, Mo. And hello, Washington Square!\"\nNear Tennessee, I met a guy who played 12-string guitar\nHe also had a mighty voice, not to mention a car\nEach time he hit those bluegrass chords, you sure smelled mountain air\nI said, \"Don't waste it on the wind. C'mon to Washington Square.\"\nIn New Orleans, we saw a gal a-walkin' with no shoes\nAn' from her throat there comes a growl, she sure was singin' the blues\nShe sang for all humanity, this gal with raven hair\nI said, \"It's for the world to hear, C'mon to Washington Square.\"\nWe cannonballed into New York on good old US 1\nTill up ahead we saw the arch, a-gleamin' bright in the sun\nAs far as all the eye could see, ten thousand folks was there\nAnd singin' in sweet harmony right in Washington Square\nSay how's about a freedom song, or the ole' \"Rock Island Line\"!\nOr how's about the dust-bowl crop, or men who work in a mine?\nThe songs and legends of our land is gold we all can share\nSo come and join us folks who stand and sing in Washington Square"
