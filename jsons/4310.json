LyricsSittin' here, sittin' here\nSittin' here, sittin' here\nAll alone\n\nI've been feelin' kinda strange lately\nI don't know what's goin' on\nEver since I came back from out of town\nSomething's tellin' me some bullshit is goin' down\n\nBoy, is it someone else you're seekin'?\nIs there someone else?\nMovado's tellin' me you're creepin'\nFindin' numbers in your jeans\nYou're talkin' in your sleep\nPhantom letters written by me\nGhetto-u-t\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else.  (Somebody else)\nNo more starin' at the phone\n'Cause I can do bad all by myself\nYeah\n\nIt's obvious how things have changed within a year.  (A year)\nJust give me half of the rent and get out of here\nNo more talkin', save your lines for somebody else\nKeep on walkin', 'cause I can do bad all by myself\n\nBoy, is it someone else you're seekin'?\nIs there someone else?\nMovado's tellin' me you're creepin'.  (Oooh, oooh)\nI'm findin' numbers in your jeans\nYou're talkin' in your sleep\nPhantom letters written by me\nGhetto-u-t\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else.  (Somebody else)\nNo more starin' at the phone\n'Cause I can do bad all by myself.  (Bad all by myself)\nNo more sittin' at home alone (Mmmm)\nWhile you're out with somebody else\n(Boy, you're with somebody else.)\nNo more starin' at the phone\n'Cause I can do bad all by myself\nI gave you all, (Ohhh) all of my time\nBut you would not know a good thing, yeah\nIf it stares you in the face\nBoy, is it someone...\nIs it someone else you're seekin'?\nIs there someone else?\nMovado's tellin' me you're creepin'.  (Oooh, oooh, oooh)\nFindin' numbers in your jeans\nYou're talkin' in your sleep\nPhantom letters written by me\nGhetto-u-t\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone (Oh, oh)\nWhile you're out with somebody else.  (Somebody else)\nNo more starin' at the phone\n'Cause I can do bad all by myself\n(I can do bad all by myself.)\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else.  (With somebody else)\nNo more starin' at the phone, (No more, no more.)\n'Cause I can do bad all by myself.  (All the ladies sing.)\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nHey, eh, eh, eh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nHey, eh, eh, eh\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh.) No more sittin' at home alone\n(Hey, eh, eh, eh.)
