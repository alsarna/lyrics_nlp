    "lyrics": "The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean\nBut you don't care how many tears I cry\nAnd though you only lead me on and hurt me\nI couldn't bring myself to say goodbye\n\n'Cause everybody's somebody's fool\nEverybody's somebody's plaything\nAnd there are no exceptions to the rule\nYes, everybody's somebody's fool\n\nI told myself it's best that I forget you\nThough I'm a fool, at least I know the score\nYet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you\nIt hurts, but I come running back for more\n\n'Cause everybody's somebody's fool\nEverybody's somebody's plaything\nAnd there are no exceptions to the rule\nYes, everybody's somebody's fool\n\nSomeday you'll find someone you really care for\nAnd if her love should prove to be untrue\nYou'll know how much this heart of mine is breakin'\nYou'll cry for her the way I've cried for you\n\nYes, everybody's somebody's fool\nEverybody's somebody's plaything\nAnd there are no exceptions to the rule\nYes, everybody's somebody's fool"
