Don't you understand Diane\n\nI said ya, ya, ya\n\nI said listen to the beat\nOh I feel it in my feet\nNow it's my heart Diane\nWhy don't you stop it! stop it!\nStop it if you can\n\nI want to spread the news that you're untrue\nBut Diane what good would it do\n'Cause way down deep inside I cry\nWithout you little Diane I'd die, I'd die\n\nOh yeah"
