    "lyrics": "Never had a doubt in the beginning\nNever a doubt\nTrusted you true in the beginning\nI loved you right through\n\nArm in arm we laughed like kids\nAt all the silly things we did\n\nYou made me promises, promises\nKnowing I'd believe\nPromises, promises\nYou knew you'd never keep\n\nSecond time around, I'm still believing\nThe words that you said\nYou said you'd always be here\n\"In love forever\" still repeats in my head\nYou can't finish what you start\nIf this is love it breaks my heart\n\nYou made me promises, promises\nYou knew you'd never keep\nPromises, promises\nWhy do I believe?\nArm in arm we laughed like kids\nAt all the silly things we did\nBut you can't finish what you start\nIf this is love it breaks my heart\n\nYou made me promises, promises\nYou knew you'd never keep\nPromises, promises\nWhy do I believe\nAll of your promises\nYou knew you'd never keep\nPromises, promises\nWhy do I believe?\n\nPromises\nPromises\nPromises\nPromises\nPromises"
