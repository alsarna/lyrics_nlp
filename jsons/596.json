    "lyrics": "My Heart Has A Mind Of Its Own LyricsI told this heart of mine\nOur love could never be\nBut then I hear your voice\nAnd something stirs inside of me\n\nSomehow I can't dismiss\nThe memory of your kiss\nGuess my heart has a mind of its own\n\nNo matter what I do\nNo matter what I say\nNo matter how I try\nI just can't turn the other way\n\nWhen I'm with someone new\nI always think of you\nGuess my heart has a mind of its own\nYou're not in love with me\nSo why can't I forget?\nI'm just your \"used-to-be\"\nIt's wrong and yet\n\nI know forgetting you\nWould be a hopeless thing\nFor I'm a puppet and I\nJust can't seem to break the string\n\nI say I'll let you go\nBut then my heart says no\nGuess my heart has a mine of its own\nGuess my heart has a mind of its ownEmbed"
