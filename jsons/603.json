Because you love me\n\nNo broken hearts for us\n'Cause we love each other\nAnd with our faith and trust\nThere could be no other\n\nWhy? 'Cause I love you\nWhy? 'Cause you love me\n\nI think you're awfully sweet\nWhy? Because I love you\nYou say I'm your special treat\nWhy? Because you love me\nWe found the perfect love\nYes, a love that's yours and mine\nI love you\nAnd you love me all the time\n\n(I'll never let you go\nWhy? Because I love you)\nYes I love you\n(I'll always love you so\nWhy? Because you lome me)\nYes you love me\n\nWe found the perfect love\nYes, a love that's yours and mine\nI love you and you love me\nI love you and you love me\nWe'll love each other dear foreverEmbed"
