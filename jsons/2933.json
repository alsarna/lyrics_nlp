    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can't get to sleep\nI think about the implications\nOf diving in too deep\nAnd possibly the complications\nEspecially at night\nI worry over situations\nI know will be all right\nPerhaps it's just imagination\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd day after day it reappears\nAnd night after night my heartbeat shows the fear\nGhosts appear and fade away\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlone between the sheets\nOnly brings exasperation\nIt's time to walk the streets\nSmell the desperation\nAt least there's pretty lights\nAnd though there's little variation\nIt nullifies the night\nFrom overkill\n\n[Chorus]\nDay after day it reappears\nNight after night my heartbeat shows the fear\nGhosts appear and fade away\nCome back another day\n[Verse 3]\nI can't get to sleep\nI think about the implications\nOf diving in too deep\nAnd possibly the complications\nEspecially at night\nI worry over situations that\nI know will be all right\nIt's just overkill\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd day after day it reappears\nAnd night after night my heartbeat shows the fear\nGhosts appear and fade away\n\n[Outro]\nGhosts appear and fade away\nGhosts appear and fade away"
