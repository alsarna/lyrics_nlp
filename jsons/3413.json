    "lyrics": "I'm alone\nYeah, I don't know if I can face the night\nI'm in tears, and the cryin' that I do is for you\n\nI want your love - let's break the walls between us\nDon't make it tough - I'll put away my pride\nEnough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light\nBaby\n\nYou're my angel\nCome and save me tonight\nYou're my angel\nCome and make it all right\n\nDon't know what I'm going to do\nAbout this feeling inside\nYes it's true - loneliness took me for a ride\n\nWithout your love - I'm nothing but a begger\nWithout your love - a dog without a bone\nWhat can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone\n\nYou're my angel\nCome and save me tonight\nYou're my angel\nCome and make it all right\nYou're the reason I live\nYou're the reason I die\nYou're the reason I give\nWhen I break down and cry\nDon't need no reason why\nBaby, baby\n\nYou're my angel\nCome and save me tonight\nYou're my angel\nCome and make it all right\n\nCome and save me tonight [x5]"
