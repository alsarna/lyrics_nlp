    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm sittin' in the railway station\nGot a ticket for my destination, mmm\nOn a tour of one night stands\nMy suitcase and guitar in hand\nAnd every stop is neatly planned\nFor a poet and a one man band\n\n[Chorus]\nHomeward bound\nI wish I was\nHomeward bound\nHome, where my thought's escaping\nHome, where my music's playing\nHome, where my love lies waiting\nSilently for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nEveryday's an endless stream\nOf cigarettes and magazines, Mmm\nAnd each town looks the same to me\nThe movies and the factories\nAnd every stranger's face I see\nReminds me that I long to be\n\n[Chorus]\nHomeward bound\nI wish I was\nHomeward bound\nHome, where my thought's escaping\nHome, where my music's playing\nHome, where my love lies waiting\nSilently for me\n[Verse 3]\nTonight I'll sing my songs again\nI'll play the game and pretend, mmm\nBut all my words come back to me\nIn shades of mediocrity\nLike emptiness in harmony\nI need someone to comfort me\n\n[Chorus]\nHomeward bound\nI wish I was\nHomeward bound\nHome, where my thought's escaping\nHome, where my music's playing\nHome, where my love lies waiting\nSilently for me\nSilently for me"
