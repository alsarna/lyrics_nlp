    "lyrics": "How do you do what you do to me\nI wish I knew\nIf I knew how you do it to me, I'd do it to you\nHow do you do what you do to me\nI'm feelin' blue\nWish I knew how you do it to me but I haven't a clue\n\nYou give me a feeling in my heart\nLike an arrow passing through it\nSpose that you think you're very smart\nBut won't you tell me how do you do it\n\nHow do you do what you do to me\nIf I only knew\nThen perhaps you'd fall for me like I fell for you\n\nYou give me a feeling in my heart\nLike an arrow passing through it\nSpose that you think you're very smart\nBut won't you tell me how do you do it\n\nHow do you do what you do to me\nIf I only knew\nThen perhaps you'd fall for me like I fell for you\nWhen I do it to you"
