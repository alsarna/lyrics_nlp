How do you like it?\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?\n\nOoh, how do you like your love?\nOoh, how do you like your love?\n\nBut if you want to know\nHow I really feel\nJust get the cameras rollin'\nGet the action goin'\nBaby you know\nMy love for you is real\nSo take me where you want to\nMe and my heart you steal\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like your love?\n\nBut if you want to know\nHow I really feel\nGet the cameras rollin'\nGet the action goin'\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?\n(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?"
