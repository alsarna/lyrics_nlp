You better bring your own spliff, chief\nWhat's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the\nJoint, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma\nCrack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it\n‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely\nI gotta take a whiz test to my P. O\nI know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro\nAnd every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a\nFatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me\n\n[Chorus: Michael Marshall]\nI got five on it; grab your '40, let's get keyed\nI got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back\nI got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack\n[Verse 3: Numskull]\nAyy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane\nMy yester-night thing got me hung off the night train\nYou fade, I fade, so let's head to the East\nHit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish\nI wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget\nStill rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket\nFoggy windows, soggy Indo\nI'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk\n\n[Verse 4: Yukmouth]\nI been smoked, Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down\nUp in the O-A-K, the Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound\nThen ease up, speed up through the E-S-O\nDrink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up\nAnd everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller\nThat's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja\nHold up, suck up my weed is all you do\nKick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu\n\n[Chorus: Michael Marshall]\nI got five on it; grab your '40, let's get keyed\nI got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back\nI got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack62Embed"
