(So cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding\nMaybe I'm just like my father: too bold\nMaybe you're just like my mother\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)\nWhy do we scream at each other?\nThis is what it sounds like\nWhen doves cry\n[Verse 3]\nTouch, if you will, my stomach (Hmm)\nFeel how it trembles inside (Mhm)\nYou've got the butterflies all tied up\nDon't make me chase you\nEven doves have pride\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can you just leave me standing\nAlone in a world so cold? (World so cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding\nMaybe I'm just like my father: too bold\nMaybe you're just like my mother\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)\nWhy do we scream at each other?\nThis is what it sounds like\nWhen doves cry\n[Bridge]\nYeah, yeah\nDoo-doo woah-oh\n(Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can you just leave me standing\nAlone in a world that's so cold? (World that's so cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)\nMaybe I'm just like my father: too bold (My father, you know he's cruel)\nMaybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)\nShe's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied, why scream?)\nWhy do we scream at each other? (Why?)\nThis is what it sounds like\nWhen doves cry\n\n[Break]\nWhen doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)\nWhen doves cry (When doves cry, they cry)\nOh, no, oh\nOh, no, yeah\nOh, oh, yeah\nOh, oh, yeah\nOh, oh, yeah\nWhen doves cry\nWhen doves cry (Hoo)\nWhen doves cry (Hoo)\nBaby, baby, baby, yeah\n[Outro]\nWhen doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)\nDon't cry\nDarling, don't cry\nDon't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry33Embed"
