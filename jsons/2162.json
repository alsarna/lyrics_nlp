    "lyrics": "This is for all the lonely  people\nThinking that life has passed them by\nDon't give up until you drink from the silver cup\nAnd ride that highway in the sky\n\nThis is for all the single people\nThinking that love has left them dry\nDon't give up until you drink from the silver cup\nYou never know until you try\n\nWell, I'm on my way\nYes, I'm back to stay\nWell, I'm on my way back home (Hit it)\n\nThis is for all the lonely people\nThinking that life has passed them by\nDon't give up until you drink from the silver cup\nAnd never take you down or never give you up\nYou never know until you try"
