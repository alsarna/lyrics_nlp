    "lyrics": "Woman\nWoman\nHave you got cheating on your mind?\nOn your mind\n\nSomething's wrong between us\nThat your laughter cannot hide\nAnd you're afraid to let your eyes meet mine\n\nAnd lately when I love you\nI know you're not satisfied\n\nWoman\nWoman\nHave you got cheating on your mind?\nOn your mind\n\nI've seen the way men look at you\nWhen they think I don't see\nAnd it hurts to have them think that you're that kind\n\nBut it's knowing that you're looking back\nThat's really killing me\n\nWoman\nWoman\nHave you got cheating on your mind?\nOn your mind\nA woman wears a certain look\nWhen she is on the move\nAnd a man can always tell what's on her mind\n\nI hate to have to say it\nBut that look's all over you\n\nWoman\nWoman\nHave you got cheating on your mind?\n\nOh, woman\nWoman\nHave you got cheating on your mind?\n\nOh, woman\nOh, ho, woman\nHave you got cheating on your mind?\n\nOh"
