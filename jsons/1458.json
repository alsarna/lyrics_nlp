    "lyrics": "Woman Woman LyricsWOMAN WOMAN\n(J.Glaser/J.Payne)\nGARY PUCKETT AND THE UNION GAP - 1968\nWoman oh woman have you got cheating on your mind?\nSomething's wrong between us that your laughter cannot hide\nAnd you're afraid to let your eyes meet mine\nAnd lately when I love you, I know you're not satisfied\nWoman oh woman have you got cheating on your mind?\nI've seen the way men look at you when they think I don't see\nAnd it hurts to have them think that you're that kind\nBut it's knowing that you're looking back that's really killing me\nWoman oh woman have you got cheating on your mind?\nA woman wears a certain look when she is on the move\nAnd a man can always tell what's on her mind\nI hate to have to say it but that look's all over you\nWoman oh woman have you got cheating on your mind?\nWoman oh woman have you got cheating on your mindEmbed"
