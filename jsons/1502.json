    "lyrics": "Jean, Jean, roses are red\nAll the leaves have gone green\nAnd the clouds are so low\nYou can touch them, and so\nCome out to the meadow, Jean\n\nJean, Jean, you're young and alive\nCome out of your half-dreamed dream\nAnd run, if you will, to the top of the hill\nOpen your arms, Bonnie Jean\n\nTill the sheep in the valley come home my way\nTill the stars fall around me and find me alone\nWhen the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'\n\nFor Jean, Jean, roses are red\nAnd all of the leaves have gone green\nWhile the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze\nCome into my arms, Bonnie Jean\n\n(Jean, Jean)\nJean, you're young and alive!!\nCome out of your half-dreamed dream\nAnd run, if you will to the top of the hill\nCome into my arms, Bonnie Jean\nJean\n\nLa-la-la-la.... (fade)"
