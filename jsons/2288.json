    "lyrics": "Crying on my pillow, lonely in my bed\nThen I heard a voice beside me and she softly said\nWonder is your night light, magic is your dream\nAnd as I held her, she said, see what I mean\n\nI said what?\nShe said oo-oo-oo wee\nI said all right\nShe said love me, love me, love me\n\nUndercover angel, midnight fantasy\nI've never had a dream that made sweet love to me\nUndercover angel, answer to my prayer\nYou made me know that there's a love for me out there\n(Somewhere) Yeah, somewhere\n\nHeavenly surrender, sweet afterglow (undercover)\nI'm givin' up my heart to you, now angel don't go\nShe said, go find the right one, love her and then (undercover)\nWhen you look into her eyes, you'll see me again\n\nI said what?\nShe said oo-oo-oo wee\nI said all right\nShe said love me, love me, love me\nUndercover angel, midnight fantasy\nI've never had a dream that made sweet love to me\nUndercover angel, answer to my prayer\nYou made me know that there's a love for me out there\n(Somewhere) Woah, somewhere\n\nNow you know my story and, girl, if it's right\nI'm gonna take you in my arms and love you tonight\nUnderneath the covers, the answer lies\nI'm lookin' for my angel in your sweet lovin' eyes\n\nShe said what?\nI said oo-oo-oo wee\nShe said all right\nI said lay next to me\nShe said what?\nI said oo-oo-oo wee\nShe said all right\nShe said love me, love me, love me\n\nUndercover angel, midnight fantasy\nI've never had a dream that made sweet love to me (ooh)\nUndercover angel, answer to my prayer\nYou made me know that there's a love for me\n\nLove me, love me, love me\nUndercover angel, midnight fantasy\nI've never had a dream that made sweet love to me\nUndercover angel, answer to my prayer\nYou made me know that there's a love for me out there\n\nOut there somewhere"
