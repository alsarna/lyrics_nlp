    "lyrics": "I believe in you and me\nI believe that we will be\nIn love eternally\nWell as far as I can see\n\nYou will always be the one for me\nOh, yes, you will\nAnd I believe in dreams again\nI believe that love will never end\n\nAnd like the river finds the sea\nI was lost, now I'm free\n'Cause I believe in you and me\n\nI will never leave your side\nI will never hurt your pride\nWhen all the chips are down\nSee I will always be around\n\nJust to be right where you are\nMy love, you know I love you\nI will never leave you out\nI will always let you in\nTo places no one's ever been\n\nDeep inside, can't you see\nThat I believe in you and me?\nMaybe I'm a fool\nTo feel the way I do\nBut I will play the fool forever\nJust to be with you forever\nI believe in miracles\nAnd love's a miracle\n\nBaby you're my dream come true\nI was lost, now I'm free\nI believe in you and me\nSee I was lost, now I'm free\n'Cause I believe in you and me\nBelieve in you and me"
