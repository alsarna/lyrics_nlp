    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHelp me, I think I'm falling in love again\nWhen I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again\nI'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler\nAnd a sweet taIking ladies man and you love your lovin'\nBut not like you love your freedom\n\n[Verse 2]\nHelp me, I think I'm falling in love too fast\nIt's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past\n'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes\nCome down to smoke and ash\nWe love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom\n\n[Verse 3]\nDidn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking\nOr lying there not talking, didn't it feel good\nYou dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking\nDidn't it feel good\nDidn't it feel good\n\n[Verse 4]\nHelp me, I think I'm falling in love with you\nAre you going to let me go there by myself\nThat's such a lonely thing to do\nBoth of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too\nWe love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom"
