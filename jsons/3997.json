    "lyrics": "Elton John LyricsThere's a calm surrender\nTo the rush of day\nWhen the heat of a rolling wave\nCan be turned away\nAn enchanted moment\nAnd it sees me through\nIt's enough for this restless warrior\nJust to be with you\nAnd can you feel the love tonight?\nIt is where we are\nIt's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer\nThat we've got this far\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)\nHow it's laid to rest?\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds\nBelieve the very best\nThere's a time for everyone\nIf they only learn\nThat the twisting kaleidoscope\nMoves us all in turn\nThere's a rhyme and reason\nTo the wild outdoors\nWhen the heart of this star-crossed voyager\nBeats in time with yours\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)\nIt is where we are\nIt's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer\nThat we've got this far\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)\nHow it's laid to rest?\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds\nBelieve the very best\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds\nBelieve the very bestEmbed"
