    "lyrics": "Down by the station early in the morning\nMet a little girl about as cute as she could be\nI turned on my charms and told her that I loved her\nI said that she would always be the number one for me\nShe'd always be my number one girl\nI said there'd be no number two or three\nDown in the malt shop shortly thereafter\nMet another girl about as cute as she could be\nI looked for number one and when I didn't see her\nI told number two she was the only girl for me\nWent to the drug store and nearly lost my life\nThere I saw my girlfriends, one and two\nStanding there together, I knew I was in trouble\nBut I'm a clever guy I knew what to do\nI went on down by the station early in the morning\nI was wooing women as cute as they could be\nBut then I saw another girl lookin kinda pretty\nI said I'm through with one and two\nI love you number three\nI said I love you number three\nAnd here's what she said to me\nJust head on down by the station early in the morning\nCatch yourself a trolley car that goes into the sea\nI want a love that's true sir, not a love like you sir\nYou weren't true to one and two\nYou won't be true to me\nDown by the station early in the morning\nSee the little puffer-bellies all in a row\nSee the station master pull the little handle\nChug, chug, woo, woo, off they go"
