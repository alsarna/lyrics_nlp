    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBabe, somewhere I know I'm gonna find it, babe\nIt'll have my love behind it\nAnd it will be a symphony of all you mean to me\nA very special love song\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd babe, if there's a way you know I'm gonna say it babe\nIf there's a melody I'll play it\nAnd I'll play it through especially for you and all the words are true\nA very special love song\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it\n'Cause I'm goin' to sing it to the whole big lonely world\nSo turn your radio way down low and get near it\nAnd I'll tell the world I love you girl\n\n[Verse 4]\nBabe, if there's an ounce of love I'm gonna give it to you\nBabe, if there's a breath of life I'm gonna live it every day for you\nAnd all the whole night through, singin' just for you\nA very special love song, for you"
