Pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray\nOh, pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay\nAnd let me love you, baby, let me love you...\n\nI want you to want me\nI need you so badly, I can't think of anything but you\nGoin' out of my head over you (Can't take my eyes off of you)\nOut of my head (You're just to good to be true)\nOut of my head, day and night, night and day and night, wrong or right\nNight and day and night, wrong or right\nNight and day and night\nAnd I think I'm goin' out of my... headEmbed"
