    "lyrics": "Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea\nAnd we breathe in the cool salty air\nYou turn to me with a kiss in your eyes\nAnd my heart feels a thrill beyond compare\nThen your lips cling to mine, it's wonderful, wonderful\nOh, so wonderful, my love\n\nSometimes we stand on the top of a hill\nAnd we gaze at the earth and the sky\nI turn to you and you melt in my arms\nHere we are, darling, only you and I\nWhat a moment to share, it's wonderful, wonderful\nOh, so wonderful, my love\n\nThe world is full of wondrous things, it's true\nBut they wouldn't have much meaning without you\n\nSome quiet evening I sit by your side\nAnd we're lost in a world of our own\nI feel the glow of your unspoken love\nI'm aware of the treasure that I own\nAnd I say to myself \"It's wonderful, wonderful\nOh, so wonderful, my love.\"\n\nAnd I say to myself \"It's wonderful, wonderful\nOh, so wonderful, my love.\""
