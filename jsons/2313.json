    "lyrics": "Sun goes down on a silky day\nQuarter moon walking through the Milky Way\nOh, you and me, baby\nWe could think of something to do\n\nIt's the right time of the night\nThe stars are winking above\nIt's the right time of the night\nFor making love\n\nNo use talking when the shadows fall\nNightbird's calling and he says it all\nOh, you and me, baby\nWe could think of something to do\n\nIt's the right time of the night\nThe stars are winking above\nIt's the right time of the night\nFor making love\n\nI got you and you got me\nTell you, that's the way my mama always said it should be\nI'll be cruel, you'll be kind\nWe'll be bad, if you don't mind\n\nIt's the right time of the night\nThe stars are winking above\nIt's the right time of the night\nFor making love\nIt's the right time of the night\nThe stars are winking above\nIt's the right time of the night\nFor making love\n\nIt's the right time of the night\nThe stars are winking above\nIt's the right time of the night\nFor making love"
