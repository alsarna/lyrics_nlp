That's what I'll say!\n[Chorus]\nI can't get no satisfaction\nI can't get no satisfaction\n'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try\nI can't get no, I can't get no\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I'm watching my TV\nAnd a man comes on and tells me\nHow white my shirts can be\nWell he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke\nThe same cigarettes as me\nI can't get no, oh no, no, no\nHey, hey, hey, that's what I say\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't get no satisfaction\nI can't get no girl reaction\n'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try\nI can't get no, I can't get no\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I'm riding 'round the world\nAnd I'm doing this and I'm signing that\nAnd I'm trying to make some girl\nWho tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week\n'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak\nI can't get no, oh no, no, no\nHey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!\n[Outro]\nI can't get no, I can't get no, I can't get no\nI can't get no satisfaction\nNo satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction\nI can't get no20Embed"
