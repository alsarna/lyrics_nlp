    "lyrics": "Well he walked up to me\nAnd he asked me if I wanted to dance\nHe looked kind of nice\nAnd so I said I might take a chance\nWhen he danced he held me tight\nAnd when he walked me home that night\nAll the stars were shining bright\nAnd then he kissed me\n\nEach time I saw him\nI couldn't wait to see him again\nI wanted to let him know\nThat he was more than a friend\nI didn't know just what to do\nSo I whispered \"I love you\"\nAnd he said that he loved me too\nAnd then he kissed me\n\nHe kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before\nKissed me In a way that I want to be kissed forever more\n\nI knew that he was mine\nSo I gave him all the love that I had\nAnd one day he took me home\nTo meet his Mom and his Dad\nThen he asked me to be his bride\nAnd always be right by his side\nI felt so happy I almost cried\nAnd then he kissed me\nThen he asked me to be his bride\nAnd always be right by his side\nI felt so happy I almost cried\nAnd then he kissed me\nAnd then he kissed me\nAnd then he kissed me"
