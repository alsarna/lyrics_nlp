    "lyrics": "I've been in love so many times\nThought I knew the score\nBut now you've treated me so wrong\nI can't take anymore\nAnd it looks like\nI'm never gonna fall in love again\nFall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love\nI mean it\nFall in love again\nAll those things I heard about you\nI thought they were only lies\nBut when I caught you in his arms\nI just broke down and cried\nAnd it looks like\nI'm never gonna fall in love again\nFall in love, no, I'm never gonna fall in love\nI mean it, I mean it\nFall in love again\nI gave my heart so easily\nI cast aside my pride\nBut when you fell for someone else, baby\nI broke up all inside\nAnd it looks like\nI'm never gonna fall in love again\nThat's why I'm a-singin' it\nFall in love, no, I'm never gonna fall in love\nPlease don't make me\nFall in love again"
