    "lyrics": "A fool never learns\nTo get away, just run away before his heart begins to break\nA fool never learns\nHe'll wait around, just hang around to see how much his heart can take\nA fool never learns\nTo some girls love is just a game\nAnd some girls treat all fool the same\nA fool never learns\nAnd I'm gonna do a very foolish thing\n\nI'm gonna stick by you\nI'm a'gonna hang around, wait around\nIn hopes you'll love me again some day\nThey say a broken heart don't mark the end of time\nThat there are lots of girls who'd love to be just mine\nBut I don't believe that I could fall in love again\n'cause I just can't remove the pain\nA fool never learns\nAnd I'm gonna do a very foolish thing\n\nI'm gonna stick by you\nI'm a'gonna hang around, wait around\nIn hopes you'll love me again some day\nThey say a broken heart don't mark the end of time\nThat there are lots of girls who'd love to be just mine\nBut I don't believe that I could fall in love again\n'cause I just can't remove the pain\nA fool never learns\nAnd I'm gonna do a very foolish thing\nAnd I'm gonna do a very foolish thing\nAnd I'm gonna do a very foolish thing"
