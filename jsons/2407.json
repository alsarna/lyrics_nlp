    "lyrics": "Too Much, Too Little, Too Late LyricsGuess it's over, call it a day\nSorry that it had to end this way\nNo reason to pretend\nWe knew it had to end some day, this way\n\nGuess, it's over, the kicks are gone\nWhat's the use of tryin' to hang on?\nSomewhere we lost the key\nSo little left for you and me and it's clear to see\n\nToo much, too little, too late to lie again with you\nToo much, too little, too late to try again with you\nWe're in the middle of ending something that we do\nIt's all over\nOh, it was over\nToo much, too little, too late to ever try again\nToo much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends\nToo much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end\nAnd it's over\nIt's over\n\nGuess it's over, the chips are down\nNearly all our bridges tumbled down\nWhatever chance we try, let's face it, why deny\nIt's over\nIt's all over\nIt's over\n\nToo much, too little, too late to ever try again\nToo much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends\nToo much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end\nAnd it's over\nAnd it's all over\nAnd it's over\n\nToo much, too little, too late to ever try again\nToo much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends\nToo much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end1Embed"
