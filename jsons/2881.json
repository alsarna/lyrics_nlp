(A-hoo!)\nShe told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me\nThen showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)\n'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby\n(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nPeople always told me, \"Be careful of what you do\nAnd don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts\"\n(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)\nBut she came and stood right by me\nJust the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)\nThis happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)\nShe called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)\nHey-ay\n[Chorus]\nBillie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one\nBut the kid is not my son\nNo-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)\nBut the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)\nShe says I am the one (Oh baby)\nBut the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)\n\n[Break]\nAh, hee-hee-hee!\nHee! Hoo!\n\n[Chorus]\nShe says I am the one, but the kid is not my son\nNo-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one\n(You know what you did to me, baby)\nBut the kid is not my son\nNo-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)\nShe says I am the one\nBut the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)\n[Outro]\nShe says I am the one\nYou know what you did\nShe says he is my son\nBreakin' my heart, babe\nShe says I am the one\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nBillie Jean is not my lover\nBillie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)\nBillie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)\n(Don't call me Billie Jean)\nBillie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)\n(Hoo! She's not at the scene)\nBillie Jean is not (Hee! Aaow! Ooh!)\nBillie Jean is134Embed"
