    "lyrics": "Each time I hold someone new\nMy arms grow cold aching for you\nNo one can take your place\nDarling in my embrace\nI'll never be free\n\nAnd when my lips burn with desire\nNo other kiss puts out the fire\nThough I may try and try\nNo one can satisfy this longing in me\n\nI'll never be free from your smile so tender\nThe sweet surrender in your eyes\nHow can I be free when I still remember\nHow you could thrill me with a sigh\n\nJust like a chain bound to my heart\nYour love remains when we're apart\nEach kiss I gave to you\nMade me a slave to you\nI'll never be free"
