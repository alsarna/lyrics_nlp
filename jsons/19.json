    "lyrics": "Iâ€™ll Never Be Free LyricsEach time I hold somebody new\nMy arms go cold aching for you\nNo one can take your place\n(Darlin' in my embrace)\nI'll never be free\n\nAnd when my lips burn with desire\nNo other kiss puts out the fire\nThough I may try and try\n(No one can satisfy)\nThis longing in me\n\n(I'll never be free from your smile so tender)\n(The sweet surrender in your eyes)\nHow can I be free when I still remember\nHow you could thrill me with a sigh\nJust like a chain bound to my heart\nYour love remains when we're apart\nEach kiss, I gave to you\n(Made me a slave to you)\nI'll never be free\n\nJust like a chain bound to my heart\nYour love remains when we're apart\nEach kiss, I gave to you\n(Made me a slave to you)\nAnd so I'll never be freeEmbed"
