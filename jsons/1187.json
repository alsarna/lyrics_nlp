(Ooh, until that day)\nHow much more can I take\nBefore loneliness (Love don't come easy)\nWill cause my heart, heart to break?\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo I can't bear\nTo live my life alone\nI grow impatient for a love\nTo call my own\nBut when I feel that I\nI can't go on\nThese precious words\nKeeps me hangin' on\nI remember Mama said\n[Chorus]\n“(You can't hurry love)\nNo, you just have to wait”\nShe said, “Love don't come easy\nIt's a game of give and take” (Can't wait)\n“You can't hurry love\nNo, you just have to wait” (Ooh, until that day)\nShe said, “Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)\nNo matter how long it takes”\n(Now break!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNo, love, love\nDon't come easy\nBut I keep on waiting\nAnticipating\nFor that soft voice\nTo talk to me at night\nFor some tender arms\nTo hold me tight\n\n[Chorus]\nI keep waiting (Can't wait ... ooh, until that day)\nI keep on waiting\nBut it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)\nIt ain't easy, but Mama said\n“You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)\nNo, you just have to wait”\nShe said, “Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)\nNo matter how long it takes”\n“You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)\nNo, you just have to wait\nShe said love don't come easy”3Embed"
