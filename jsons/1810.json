    "lyrics": "Last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no\nI lay awake and watched until the morning light\nWashed away the darkness of the lonely night (Lonely night)\n\nOh, and last night, I got to thinking maybe I, I, I\nShould call you up and just forget my foolish pride\nI heard your number ringing, I went cold inside\nAnd last night, I didn't get to sleep at all\n\nI know it's not my fault, I did my best\nGod knows this heart of mine could use a rest\nBut more and more I find the dreams I left behind\nAre somehow too real to replace (Replace)\n\nOh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no\nThe sleeping pill I took was just a waste of time\nI couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind\nAnd last night, I didn't get to sleep, didn't get to sleep\nNo, I didn't get to sleep at all\n\nBut more and more I find the dreams I left behind\nAre somehow too real to replace (Replace)\n\nOh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no\nThe sleeping pill I took was just a waste of time\nI couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind\nAnd last night, I didn't get to sleep, didn't get to sleep\nNo, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no, no\n(No, no, no) No, no, no\nOh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no\nLast night, I didn't get to sleep at all, oh, oh\nLast night"
