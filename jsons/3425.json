Other half die\nMakes you wonder, wonder, wonder\n\nHere come the man, with the look in his eye\nFed on nothing, but full of pride\nLook at them go, look at them kick\nMakes you wonder, how the other half live\n\n[Hook]\nThe devil inside, the devil inside\nEvery single one of us the devil inside\nThe devil inside, the devil inside\nEvery single one of us the devil inside\n[Verse 2]\nHere come the world, with the look in its eye\nFuture uncertain, but certainly slight\nLook at the faces, listen to the bells\nIt's hard to believe we need a place called hell, place called hell\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere comes the woman, with the look in her eye\nRaised on leather, with flesh on her mind\nWords as weapons sharper than knives\nMakes you wonder, how the other half die\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro]\nThe devil inside, yeah, yeah, yeah\nThe devil inside, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed"
