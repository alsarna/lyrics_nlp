    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIf you're ready, I'm willing and able\nHelp me lay my cards out on the table\nYou're mine and I'm yours for the taking\nRight now the rules we made are meant for breaking\nWhat you get ain't always what you see\nBut satisfaction's guaranteed\nThey say what you give is always what you need\nSo if you want me to lay my hands on you\n\n[Chorus]\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher\nI've been to school and baby, I've been the teacher\nIf you show me how to get up off the ground\nI can show you how to fly and never ever come back down\nEverything you want is what I need\nSatisfaction's guaranteed\nBut the ride don't never ever come for free\nIf you want me to lay my hands on you\n[Chorus]\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\nLay your hands on me\n\n[Outro]\nDon't you know I only aim to please\nIf you want me to lay my hands on you\nLay your hands on me"
