    "lyrics": "Many years since I was here\nOn the street I was passin' my time away\nTo the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky\nIt's outta sight in the dead of night\n\n(Ooh) Here I am, and in this city\n(Ooh) With a fistful of dollars\nAnd baby, you'd better believe\n\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nBack in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove\n\nIn the back of my Cadillac\nA wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' \"Where are we?\"\nStop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night\nIt's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me\n\n(Ooh) I feel so good tonight\n(Ooh) Who cares about tomorrow\nSo baby, you'd better believe\n\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nBack in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\n\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\n\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove\nI'm back, back in the New York Groove"
