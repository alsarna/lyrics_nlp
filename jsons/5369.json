Can you run all the lights?\nIf you can, baby boy, then we can go all night\n‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five\nBaby, you got the keys\nNow shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)\nShut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've got class like a '57 Cadillac\nGot overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back\nYou look like you can handle what's under my hood\nYou keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo if you feel me, let me know, know, know\nCome on now, what you waitin' for, for, for\nMy engine's ready to explode, explode, explode\nSo start me up and watch me go, go, go, go\n\n[Chorus]\nGet you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean\nGot a ride that's smoother than a limousine\nCan you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?\nIf you can, baby boy, then we can go all night\n‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five\nBaby, you got the keys\nNow shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)\nShut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)\n\n[Bridge]\n‘Cause your Maybach, ain't got what I got (Get it, get it)\nDon't stop, it's a sure shot\nAnd your Ferrari, huh boy, I'm sorry\nI ain't even worried, so step inside and ride\n(Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo if you feel me, let me know, know, know\nCome on now, what you waitin' for, for, for\nMy engine's ready to explode, explode, explode\nSo start me up and watch me go, go, go, go\n[Chorus]\nGet you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean\nGot a ride that's smoother than a limousine\nCan you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?\nIf you can, baby boy, then we can go all night\n‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five\nBaby, you got the keys\nNow shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)\nShut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)\nShut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)\nShut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive)"
