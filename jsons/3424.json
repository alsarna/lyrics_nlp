(monkey)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOh I count to ten\nBut I don't know how and I don't know when\nTo open my eyes\nIf you kiss me again\nLike you did just now, like you did just then (just do it again)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've had the rest\nNow it's time I had the best\nSo you tell me that you won't do anymore\nWell I'd write your heart a letter\nBut I think you know me better\nIf I keep on askin' baby, maybe\nI'll get what I'm askin' for\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy can't you set your monkey free?\nAlways givin' into it\nDo you love your monkey or do you love me?\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy do I have to share my baby with a monkey (monkey)\nWith a monkey? (monkey)\n[Verse 2]\nOh I hate your friends\nBut I don't know how and I don't know when\nTo open your eyes\nYes the monkey's back again\nDo you want him now like you did back then? (don't do it again)\nBack, then, then, back, then, then\nBack, back (do it again)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI tried my best\nBut your head is such a mess\nSo I guess that I don't want you anymore\nWell you say you care about me\nThat you just can't do without me\nBut you keep on dancin' baby\n'Til that monkey has you on the floor\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy can't you set your monkey free?\nAlways givin' into it\nDo you love your monkey or do you love me?\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy do I have to share my baby with a monkey (monkey)\nWith a monkey? (monkey)\n[Bridge]\n(Monkey, monkey...)\nDon't look now\nThere's a monkey on your back\nDon't look now\nThere's a monkey on you\nDon't look now\nThere's a monkey on your back\nDon't look now\nThere's a monkey on you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo you tell me that you won't do anymore\nKeep on askin' baby, maybe\nI'll get what I'm askin' for\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy can't you set your monkey free?\nAlways givin' into it\nDo you love your monkey or do you love me?\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy do I have to share my baby with a monkey (monkey)\nWith a monkey? (monkey)\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy can't you set your monkey free?\nAlways givin' into it\nDo you love your monkey or do you love me?\nWhy can't you do it?\nWhy do I have to share my baby with a monkey (monkey)\nWith a monkey? (monkey)\n[Outro]\n(Monkey, monkey, monkey)\n(Monkey, monkey, monkey)\n(Monkey, monkey, monkey)\n(Monkey, monkey, mon-mon-mon-mon-monkey)"
