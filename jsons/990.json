    "lyrics": "People LyricsPeople...\nPeople who need people\nAre the luckiest people in the world\nWe're children, needing other children\nAnd yet letting a grown-up pride\nHide all the need inside\nActing more like children than children\n\nLovers...\nAre very special people\nThey're the luckiest people in the world\nWith one person\nOne very special person\nA feeling deep in your soul\nSays you were half now you're whole\nNo more hunger and thirst\nFirst be a person who needs people\nPeople who need people\nAre the luckiest people in the world\nA feeling deep in your soul\nSays you were half now you're whole\nNo more hunger and thirst\nFirst be a person who needs people\nPeople who need people\nAre the luckiest people in the worldEmbed"
