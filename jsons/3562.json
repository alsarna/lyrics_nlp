Yes we're fake, faithful no one wasteful someone\n\nThere's just not enough flat notes see kid, to sing the eulogy\nNor enough tone deaf fans, we need the tone deaf to listen\nThere's just not enough flat notes see kid, to sing the eulogy\nNor enough tone deaf fans, we need the tone deaf to listen\n\nC'est la vie"
