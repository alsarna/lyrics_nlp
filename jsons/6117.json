Have I lost ya?\nEven though I know you love me, can't help it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI turn my chin music up\nAnd I'm puffing my chest\nI'm getting red in the face\nYou can call me obsessed\nIt's not your fault that they hover\nI mean no disrespect\nIt's my right to be hellish\nI still get jealous\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you're too sexy beautiful\nAnd everybody wants a taste\nThat's why (That's why) I still get jealous\n'Cause you're too sexy beautiful\nAnd everybody wants a taste\nThat's why (That's why) I still get jealous\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wish you didn't have to post it all\nI wish you'd save a little bit just for me\nProtective or possessive?
