(Let me down)\nAnd mess me around\nAnd then, worst of all (Worst of all)\nYou never call, baby\nWhen you say you will (Say you will)\nBut I love you still\nI need you (I need you)\nMore than anyone, darling\nYou know that I have from the start\nSo build me up (Build me up)\nButtercup, don't break my heart\n\n[Verse 1]\n\"I'll be over at ten\", you told me time and again\nBut you're late, I wait around and then (Ba-dah-dah)\nI went to the door, I can't take any more\nIt's not you, you let me down again (Hey, hey, hey)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBaby, baby, try to find (Hey, hey, hey)\nA little time and I'll make you happy (Hey, hey, hey)\nI'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you\nOoh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy do you build me up (Build me up)\nButtercup, baby\nJust to let me down? (Let me down)\nAnd mess me around\nAnd then, worst of all (Worst of all)\nYou never call, baby\nWhen you say you will (Say you will)\nBut I love you still\nI need you (I need you)\nMore than anyone, darling\nYou know that I have from the start\nSo build me up (Build me up)\nButtercup, don't break my heart\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo you, I'm a toy, but I could be the boy you adore\nIf you'd just let me know (Ba-dah-dah)\nAlthough you're untrue, I'm attracted to you all the more\nWhy do I need you so? (Hey, hey, hey)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBaby, baby, try to find (Hey, hey, hey)\nA little time and I'll make you happy (Hey, hey, hey)\nI'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you\nOoh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy do you build me up (Build me up)\nButtercup, baby\nJust to let me down?
