    "lyrics": "Mama LyricsWhen the evening shadows fall\nAnd the lovely day is through\nThen with longing I recall\nThe years I spent with you\n\nMama, I miss the days\nWhen you were near to guide me\nMama, those happy days\nWhen you were here beside me\n\nSafe in the glow of your love\nSent from the heavens above\nNothing can ever replace\nThe warmth of your tender embrace\n\nOh, Mama, until the day\nThat we're together once more\nI'll live in these memories\nUntil the day that we're together once moreEmbed"
