    "lyrics": "Gone LyricsSince you've gone the moon the sun the stars in the sky know the reason why I cry\nLove divine once was mine now you've gone\nSince you've gone my heart my lips my tear dimmed eyes a lonely soul within me cries\nI acted smart broke your heart now you've gone\nOh what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted\nThe love that I've tasted I was wrong now you've gone\n\nOh what I'd give for the lifetime...Embed"
