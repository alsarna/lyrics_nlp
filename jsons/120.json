    "lyrics": "Blow me a kiss across the room\nSay I look nice when I'm not\nTouch my hair as you pass my chair\nLittle things mean a lot\n\nGive me your arm as we cross the street\nCall me at six on the dot\nA line a day when you're far away\nLittle things mean a lot\n\nDon't have to buy me diamonds or pearls\nChampagne, sables or such\nI never cared much for diamonds and pearls\n'Cause honestly, honey, they just cost money\n\nGive me your hand when I've lost my way\nGive me your shoulder to cry on\nWhether the day is bright or gray\nGive me your heart to rely on\n\nSend me the warmth of a secret smile\nTo show me you haven't forgot\nFor always and ever, now and forever\nLittle things mean a lot\n\nGive me your hand when I've lost my way\nGive me your shoulder to cry on\nWhether the day is bright or gray\nGive me your heart to rely on\nSend me the warmth of a secret smile\nTo show me you haven't forgot\nFor always and ever, now and forever\nLittle things mean a lot"
