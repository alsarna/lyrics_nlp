    "lyrics": "Everybody Loves Somebody LyricsEverybody loves somebody sometime\nEverybody falls in love somehow\nSomething in your kiss just told me\nMy sometime is now\n\nEverybody finds somebody someplace\nTheres no tellin' where love may appear\nSomething in my heart keeps sayin'\nMy someplace is here\n\nIf I had it in my power\nI'd arrange for every girl to have your charm\nThen every minute every hour\nEvery boy would find what I found in your arms\n\nEverybody loves somebody sometime\nAnd although my dream was overdue\nYour love made it well worth waiting\nFor someone like you\n(If I had it in my power)\nI'd arrange for every girl to have your charm\n(Then every minute every hour)\nEvery boy would find what I found in your arms\n\nEverybody loves somebody sometime\nAnd although my dream was overdue\nYour love made it well worth waiting\nFor someone like you\n(Everybody loves somebody sometime)Embed"
