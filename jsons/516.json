Kookie, Kookie?\nEDD: Well now, let's take it from the top and grab some wheels\nAnd on the way we'll talk about some cuckoo deals\nCONNIE: But Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?\nEDD: Now you're on my wavelength, and I'm reading you just fine\nDon't cut out of here til we get on Cloud Nine!\nCONNIE: But Kookie, Kookie?\nEDD: I got smog in my noggin, ever since you made the scene\n(You're the utmost!)\nIf you ever tune me out\nDad, I'm the saddest, like I'm green\n(The very utmost!)\nCONNIE: Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?\nEDD: Man, I got my burners lighted, and my flaps are gonna bend\nYou're gonna send me to that planet called—you know it, baby—the end!\nCONNIE: Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?\nEDWARD: If you ever cut out, then I'd be a stray cat\n'Cause when I'm flyin' solo, nowhere's where I'm at!\nCONNIE: Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. Kookie, Kookie?\nEDWARD: What's with this comb caper, baby?! Why do you wanna latch onto my comb?!\nCONNIE: I just want you to stop combing your hair... and kiss me. You're the maximum utmost!\nEDD: Well, I'm beamed and I'm dreamsville and I'm movin' right now, cause that's the kind of scene that I dig! Baby...you're the ginchiest"
