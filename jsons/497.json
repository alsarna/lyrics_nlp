    "lyrics": "Alone in my quiet village I pray\nYou will be returning one day\nTo me\nReturn to me\nAlone living with the mem'ry of you\nPromising you'd always be true\nTo me\nBe true to me\nAbove me there's a moon on fire\nTelling you to love me as I desire\nAnd ever the flame in my quiet village will burn\nDarling till the day you return to me\nReturn to me, return to me"
