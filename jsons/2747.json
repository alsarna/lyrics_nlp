    "lyrics": "Stand up in a clear blue morning\nUntil you see what can be\nAlone in a cold day dawning\nAre you still free? Can you be?\n\nWhen some cold tomorrow finds you\nWhen some sad old dream reminds you\nHow the endless road unwinds you\n\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance fake it\nBecause it's all on you\n\nDon't you know by now\nNo one gives you anything?\nAnd don't you wonder how you keep on moving?\nOne more day your way, oh your way\n\nWhen there's no one left to leave you\nEven you don't quite believe you\nThat's when nothing can deceive you\n\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance fake it\nBecause it's all on you\nStand up in a clear blue morning\nUntil you see what can be\nAlone in a cold day dawning\nAre you still free? Can you be?\n\nAnd that old gray wind is blowing\nAnd there's nothing left worth knowing\nAnd its time you should be going\n\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance fake it\nBecause it's all on you\n\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance\n\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance\n\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance take it\nFind romance"
