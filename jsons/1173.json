    "lyrics": "Why can I be like any guy?\nWhy do they try and make me run? Son of a gun\n\nNow what do they care about the clothes I wear?\nWhy get their kicks from making fun\n\nYeah, this world's got a lot of space\nAnd if they don't like my face\nIt ain't me that's going any where, no\n\nSo I don't care then laugh at me\nIf that's so fair, I have to beg to be free\nThen, baby, laugh at me and I'll cry for you\nAnd I'll pray for you and I'll do all the things\nThat the man up stairs says to do\nI'll do 'em for you, I'll do 'em, I'll do 'em all for you\n\nIt's gotta start some place\nIt's gotta start some how\nI'll make that other cheek mine\nAnd maybe the next guy\nThat don't wear a silk tie\nHe can walk by and say hi\nSay hi instead of why\nInstead of why\nInstead of why, babe\nInstead of why\nWhat did I do to you?"
