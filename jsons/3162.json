    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn the moonlight\nUnder startlite\nSongs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of\nEverybody's hard as iron\nLocked in a modern world\nDreams are made of a different stuff\n\n[Bridge]\nI believe love will always be the same\nWays and means are the parts subject to change\n\n[Chorus]\nM-e-t-h-o-d-o-f-l-o-v-e\nIt's the method of modern love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can call you\nGot your number\nShare my life with you a thousand miles away\nIf you've hurt me\nI haven't shown it\nTimes too tight to fight\nAnd we're never face to face\n\n[Bridge]\nStyle is timeless and fashion's only now\nWe've got the ways no one needs to show us how\n[Chorus]\nM-e-t-h-o-d-o-f-l-o-v-e\nIt's the method of modern love\n\nIt's the modern love\n[Chorus]\nM-e-t-h-o-d-o-f-l-o-v-e\nIt's the method of modern love"
