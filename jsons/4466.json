    "lyrics": "Part III\n\nLIGHTS flicked on and house-doors opened all down the street, to watch the carnival set up.\nMontag and Beatty stared, one with dry satisfaction, the other with disbelief, at the house before them, this main ring in which torches would be juggled and fire eaten.\n\"Well,\" said Beatty, \"now you did it. Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that he's burnt his damn wings, he wonders why. Didn't I hint enough when I sent the Hound around your place?\"\nMontag's face was entirely numb and featureless; he felt his head turn like a stone carving to the dark place next door, set in its bright borders of flowers.\nBeatty snorted. \"Oh, no! You weren't fooled by that little idiot's routine, now, were you? Flowers, butterflies, leaves, sunsets, oh, hell! It's all in her file. I'll be damned. I've hit the bullseye. Look at the sick look on your face. A few grass-blades and the quarters of the moon. What trash. What good did she ever do with all that?\"\nMontag sat on the cold fender of the Dragon, moving his head half an inch to the left, half an inch to the right, left, right, left right, left ....\n\"She saw everything. She didn't do anything to anyone. She just let them alone.\"\n\"Alone, hell ! She chewed around you, didn't she? One of those damn do-gooders with their shocked, holier-than-thou silences, their one talent making others feel guilty. God damn, they rise like the midnight sun to sweat you in your bed!\"\nThe front door opened; Mildred came down the steps, running, one suitcase held with a dreamlike clenching rigidity in her fist, as a beetle-taxi hissed to the curb.\n\"Mildred! \"\nShe ran past with her body stiff, her face floured with powder, her mouth gone, without lipstick.\n\"Mildred, you didn't put in the alarm!\"\nShe shoved the valise in the waiting beetle, climbed in, and sat mumbling, \"Poor family, poor family, oh everything gone, everything, everything gone now ....\"\nBeatty grabbed Montag's shoulder as the beetle blasted away and hit seventy miles an hour, far down the street, gone.\nThere was a crash like the falling parts of a dream fashioned out of warped glass, mirrors, and crystal prisms. Montag drifted about as if still another incomprehensible storm had turned him, to see Stoneman and Black wielding axes, shattering window-panes to provide cross-ventilation.\nThe brush of a death's-head moth against a cold black screen. \"Montag, this is Faber. Do you hear me? What's happening?\"\n\"This is happening to me,\" said Montag.\n\"What a dreadful surprise,\" said Beatty. \"For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is certain, that nothing will ever happen to me. Others die, I go on. There are no consequences and no responsibilities. Except that there are. But let's not talk about them, eh? By the time the consequences catch up with you, it's too late, isn't it, Montag?\"\n\"Montag, can you get away, run?\" asked Faber.\nMontag walked but did not feel his feet touch the cement and then the night grasses. Beatty flicked his igniter nearby and the small orange flame drew his fascinated gaze.\n\"What is there about fire that's so lovely? No matter what age we are, what draws us to it?\"\nBeatty blew out the flame and lit it again. \"It's perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did. Or almost perpetual motion. If you let it go on, it'd burn our lifetimes out. What is\nfire? It's a mystery. Scientists give us gobbledegook about friction and molecules. But they don't\nreally know. Its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences. A problem gets\ntoo burdensome, then into the furnace with it. Now, Montag, you're a burden. And fire will lift\nyou off my shoulders, clean, quick, sure; nothing to rot later. Antibiotic, aesthetic, practical.\"\nMontag stood looking in now at this queer house, made strange by the hour of the night, by\nmurmuring neighbour voices, by littered glass, and there on the floor, their covers torn off and\nspilled out like swan-feathers, the incredible books that looked so silly and really not worth\nbothering with, for these were nothing but black type and yellowed paper, and ravelled binding.\nMildred, of course. She must have watched him hide the books in the garden and brought them\nback in. Mildred. Mildred.\n\"I want you to do this job all by your lonesome, Montag. Not with kerosene and a match, but\npiecework, with a flamethrower. Your house, your clean-up.\"\n\"Montag, can't you run, get away!\"\n\"No!\" cried Montag helplessly. \"The Hound! Because of the Hound!\"\nFaber heard, and Beatty, thinking it was meant for him, heard. \"Yes, the Hound's somewhere\nabout the neighbourhood, so don't try anything. Ready?\"\n\"Ready.\" Montag snapped the safety-catch on the flamethrower.\n\"Fire!\"\nA great nuzzling gout of flame leapt out to lap at the books and knock them against the wall. He\nstepped into the bedroom and fired twice and the twin beds went up in a great simmering\nwhisper, with more heat and passion and light than he would have supposed them to contain. He\nburnt the bedroom walls and the cosmetics chest because he wanted to change everything, the\nchairs, the tables, and in the dining-room the silverware and plastic dishes, everything that\nshowed that he had lived here in this empty house with a strange woman who would forget him\ntomorrow, who had gone and quite forgotten him already, listening to her Seashell radio pour in\non her and in on her as she rode across town, alone. And as before, it was good to burn, he felt\nhimself gush out in the fire, snatch, rend, rip in half with flame, and put away the senseless\nproblem. If there was no solution, well then now there was no problem, either. Fire was best for\neverything!\n\"The books, Montag!\"\nThe books leapt and danced like roasted birds, their wings ablaze with red and yellow feathers.\nAnd then he came to the parlour where the great idiot monsters lay asleep with their white\nthoughts and their snowy dreams. And he shot a bolt at each of the three blank walls and the\nvacuum hissed out at him. The emptiness made an even emptier whistle, a senseless scream. He\ntried to think about the vacuum upon which the nothingness had performed, but he could not. He\nheld his breath so the vacuum could not get into his lungs. He cut off its terrible emptiness, drew\nback, and gave the entire room a gift of one huge bright yellow flower of burning. The fire-proof\nplastic sheath on everything was cut wide and the house began to shudder with flame.\n\"When you're quite finished,\" said Beatty behind him. \"You're under arrest.\"\nThe house fell in red coals and black ash. It bedded itself down in sleepy pink-grey cinders and a\nsmoke plume blew over it, rising and waving slowly back and forth in the sky. It was three-thirty\nin the morning. The crowd drew back into the houses; the great tents of the circus had slumped\ninto charcoal and rubble and the show was well over.\nMontag stood with the flame-thrower in his limp hands, great islands of perspiration drenching\nhis armpits, his face smeared with soot. The other firemen waited behind him, in the darkness,\ntheir faces illuminated faintly by the smouldering foundation.\nMontag started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together.\n\"Was it my wife turned in the alarm?\"\nBeatty nodded. \"But her friends turned in an alarm earlier, that I let ride. One way or the other,\nyou'd have got it. It was pretty silly, quoting poetry around free and easy like that. It was the act\nof a silly damn snob. Give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks he's the Lord of all Creation.\nYou think you can walk on water with your books. Well, the world can get by just fine without\nthem. Look where they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I stir the slime with my little finger,\nyou'll drown ! \"\nMontag could not move. A great earthquake had come with fire and levelled the house and\nMildred was under there somewhere and his entire life under there and he could not move. The\nearthquake was still shaking and falling and shivering inside him and he stood there, his knees\nhalf-bent under the great load of tiredness and bewilderment and outrage, letting Beatty hit him\nwithout raising a hand.\n\"Montag, you idiot, Montag, you damn fool; why did you really do it?\"\nMontag did not hear, he was far away, he was running with his mind, he was gone, leaving this\ndead soot-covered body to sway in front of another raving fool.\n\"Montag, get out of there! \" said Faber.\nMontag listened.\nBeatty struck him a blow on the head that sent him reeling back. The green bullet in which\nFaber's voice whispered and cried, fell to the sidewalk. Beatty snatched it up, grinning. He held it\nhalf in, half out of his ear.\nMontag heard the distant voice calling, \"Montag, you all right?\"\nBeatty switched the green bullet off and thrust it in his pocket. \"Well--so there's more here than I\nthought. I saw you tilt your head, listening. First I thought you had a Seashell. But when you\nturned clever later, I wondered. We'll trace this and drop it on your friend.\"\n\"No! \" said Montag.\nHe twitched the safety catch on the flame-thrower. Beatty glanced instantly at Montag's fingers\nand his eyes widened the faintest bit. Montag saw the surprise there and himself glanced to his\nhands to see what new thing they had done. Thinking back later he could never decide whether\nthe hands or Beatty's reaction to the hands gave him the final push toward murder. The last\nrolling thunder of the avalanche stoned down about his ears, not touching him.\nBeatty grinned his most charming grin. \"Well, that's one way to get an audience. Hold a gun on a\nman and force him to listen to your speech. Speech away. What'll it be this time? Why don't you\nbelch Shakespeare at me, you fumbling snob? `There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I\nam arm'd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as an idle wind, which I respect not!' How's\nthat? Go ahead now, you second-hand litterateur, pull the trigger.\" He took one step toward\nMontag.\nMontag only said, \"We never burned right...\"\n\"Hand it over, Guy,\" said Beatty with a fixed smile.\nAnd then he was a shrieking blaze, a jumping, sprawling, gibbering mannikin, no longer human\nor known, all writhing flame on the lawn as Montag shot one continuous pulse of liquid fire on\nhim. There was a hiss like a great mouthful of spittle banging a redhot stove, a bubbling and\nfrothing as if salt had been poured over a monstrous black snail to cause a terrible liquefaction\nand a boiling over of yellow foam. Montag shut his eyes, shouted, shouted, and fought to get his\nhands at his ears to clamp and to cut away the sound. Beatty flopped over and over and over, and\nat last twisted in on himself like a charred wax doll and lay silent.\nThe other two firemen did not move.\nMontag kept his sickness down long enough to aim the flame-thrower. \"Turn around!\"\nThey turned, their faces like blanched meat, streaming sweat; he beat their heads, knocking off\ntheir helmets and bringing them down on themselves. They fell and lay without moving.\nThe blowing of a single autumn leaf.\nHe turned and the Mechanical Hound was there.\nIt was half across the lawn, coming from the shadows, moving with such drifting ease that it was\nlike a single solid cloud of black-grey smoke blown at him in silence.\nIt made a single last leap into the air, coming down at Montag from a good three feet over his\nhead, its spidered legs reaching, the procaine needle snapping out its single angry tooth. Montag\ncaught it with a bloom of fire, a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of yellow and blue\nand orange about the metal dog, clad it in a new covering as it slammed into Montag and threw\nhim ten feet back against the bole of a tree, taking the flame-gun with him. He felt it scrabble and\nseize his leg and stab the needle in for a moment before the fire snapped the Hound up in the air,\nburst its metal bones at the joints, and blew out its interior in the single flushing of red colour\nlike a skyrocket fastened to the street. Montag lay watching the dead-alive thing fiddle the air\nand die. Even now it seemed to want to get back at him and finish the injection which was now\nworking through the flesh of his leg. He felt all of the mingled relief and horror at having pulled\nback only in time to have just his knee slammed by the fender of a car hurtling by at ninety miles\nan hour. He was afraid to\nget up, afraid he might not be able to gain his feet at all, with an anaesthetized leg. A numbness\nin a numbness hollowed into a numbness....\nAnd now...?\nThe street empty, the house burnt like an ancient bit of stage-scenery, the other homes dark, the\nHound here, Beatty there, the three other firemen another place, and the Salamander . . . ? He\ngazed at the immense engine. That would have to go, too.\nWell, he thought, let's see how badly off you are. On your feet now. Easy, easy . . . there.\nHe stood and he had only one leg. The other was like a chunk of burnt pine-log he was carrying\nalong as a penance for some obscure sin. When he put his weight on it, a shower of silver\nneedles gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee. He wept. Come on! Come on,\nyou, you can't stay here!\nA few house-lights were going on again down the street, whether from the incidents just passed,\nor because of the abnormal silence following the fight, Montag did not know. He hobbled around\nthe ruins, seizing at his bad leg when it lagged, talking and whimpering and shouting directions\nat it and cursing it and pleading with it to work for him now when it was vital. He heard a\nnumber of people crying out in the darkness and shouting. He reached the back yard and the\nalley. Beatty, he thought, you're not a problem now. You always said, don't face a problem, bum\nit. Well, now I've done both. Good-bye, Captain.\nAnd he stumbled along the alley in the dark.\nA shotgun blast went off in his leg every time he put it down and he thought, you're a fool, a\ndamn fool, an awful fool, an idiot, an awful idiot, a damn idiot, and a fool, a damn fool; look at\nthe mess and where's the mop, look at the mess, and what do you do? Pride, damn it, and temper,\nand you've junked it all, at the very start you vomit on everyone and on yourself. But everything\nat once, but everything one on top of another; Beatty, the women, Mildred, Clarisse, everything.\nNo excuse, though, no excuse. A fool, a damn fool, go give yourself up!\nNo, we'll save what we can, we'll do what there is left to do. If we have to burn, let's take a few\nmore with us. Here!\nHe remembered the books and turned back. Just on the off chance.\nHe found a few books where he had left them, near the garden fence. Mildred, God bless her, had\nmissed a few. Four books still lay hidden where he had put them. Voices were wailing in the\nnight and flashbeams swirled about. Other Salamanders were roaring their engines far away, and\npolice sirens were cutting their way across town with their sirens.\nMontag took the four remaining books and hopped, jolted, hopped his way down the alley and\nsuddenly fell as if his head had been cut off and only his body lay there. Something inside had\njerked him to a halt and flopped him down. He lay where he had fallen and sobbed, his legs\nfolded, his face pressed blindly to the gravel.\nBeatty wanted to die.\nIn the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just\nstood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there, joking, needling, thought Montag,\nand the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air. How strange, strange,\nto want to die so much that you let a man walk around armed and then instead of shutting up and\nstaying alive, you go on yelling at people and making fun of them until you get them mad, and\nthen ....\nAt a distance, running feet.\nMontag sat up. Let's get out of here. Come on, get up, get up, you just can't sit! But he was still\ncrying and that had to be finished. It was going away now. He hadn't wanted to kill anyone, not\neven Beatty. His flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid. He gagged. He\nsaw Beatty, a torch, not moving, fluttering out on the grass. He bit at his knuckles. I'm sorry, I'm\nsorry, oh God, sorry ....\nHe tried to piece it all together, to go back to the normal pattern of life a few short days ago\nbefore the sieve and the sand, Denham's Dentifrice, moth-voices, fireflies, the alarms and\nexcursions, too much for a few short days, too much, indeed, for a lifetime.\nFeet ran in the far end of the alley.\n\"Get up!\" he told himself. \"Damn it, get up!\" he said to the leg, and stood. The pains were spikes\ndriven in the kneecap and then only darning needles and then only common, ordinary safety pins,\nand after he had dragged along fifty more hops and jumps, filling his hand with slivers from the\nboard fence, the prickling was like someone blowing a spray of scalding water on that leg. And\nthe leg was at last his own leg again. He had been afraid that running might break the loose\nankle. Now, sucking all the night into his open mouth, and blowing it out pale, with all the\nblackness left heavily inside himself, he set out in a steady jogging pace. He carried the books in\nhis hands.\nHe thought of Faber.\nFaber was back there in the steaming lump of tar that had no name or identity now. He had burnt\nFaber, too. He felt so suddenly shocked by this that he felt Faber was really dead, baked like a\nroach in that small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was now nothing\nbut a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons.\nYou must remember, burn them or they'll burn you, he thought. Right now it's as simple as that.\nHe searched his pockets, the money was there, and in his other pocket he found the usual\nSeashell upon which the city was talking to itself in the cold black morning.\n\"Police Alert. Wanted: Fugitive in city. Has committed murder and crimes against the State.\nName: Guy Montag. Occupation: Fireman. Last seen . . .\"\nHe ran steadily for six blocks, in the alley, and then the alley opened out on to a wide empty\nthoroughfare ten lanes wide. It seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the\nhigh white arc-lamps; you could drown trying to cross it, he felt; it was too wide, it was too open.\nIt was a vast stage without scenery, inviting him to run across, easily seen in the blazing\nillumination, easily caught, easily shot down.\nThe Seashell hummed in his ear.\n\"... watch for a man running ... watch for the running man . . . watch for a man alone, on foot . . .\nwatch...\"\nMontag pulled back into the shadows. Directly ahead lay a gas station, a great chunk of porcelain\nsnow shining there, and two silver beetles pulling in to fill up. Now he must be clean and\npresentable if he wished, to walk, not run, stroll calmly across that wide boulevard. It would give\nhim an extra margin of safety if he washed up and combed his hair before he went on his way to\nget where . . . ?\nYes, he thought, where am I running?\nNowhere. There was nowhere to go, no friend to turn to, really. Except Faber. And then he\nrealized that he was indeed, running toward Faber's house, instinctively. But Faber couldn't hide\nhim; it would be suicide even to try. But he knew that he would go to see Faber anyway, for a\nfew short minutes. Faber's would be the place where he might refuel his fast draining belief in\nhis own ability to survive. He just wanted to know that there was a man like Faber in the world.\nHe wanted to see the man alive and not burned back there like a body shelled in another body.\nAnd some of the money must be left with Faber, of course, to be spent after Montag ran on his\nway. Perhaps he could make the open country and live on or near the rivers and near the\nhighways, in the fields and hills.\nA great whirling whisper made him look to the sky.\nThe police helicopters were rising so far away that it seemed someone had blown the grey head\noff a dry dandelion flower. Two dozen of them flurried, wavering, indecisive, three miles off,\nlike butterflies puzzled by autumn, and then they were plummeting down to land, one by one,\nhere, there, softly kneading the streets where, turned back to beetles, they shrieked along the\nboulevards or, as suddenly, leapt back into the sir, continuing their search.\nAnd here was the gas station, its attendants busy now with customers. Approaching from the\nrear, Montag entered the men's washroom. Through the aluminium wall he heard a radio voice\nsaying, \"War has been declared.\" The gas was being pumped outside. The men in the beetles\nwere talking and the attendants were talking about the engines, the gas, the money owed. Montag\nstood trying to make himself feel the shock of the quiet statement from the radio, but nothing\nwould happen. The war would have to wait for him to come to it in his personal file, an hour,\ntwo hours from now.\nHe washed his hands and face and towelled himself dry, making little sound. He came out of the\nwashroom and shut the door carefully and walked into the darkness and at last stood again on the\nedge of the empty boulevard.\nThere it lay, a game for him to win, a vast bowling alley in the cool morning. The boulevard was\nas clean as the surface of an arena two minutes before the appearance of certain unnamed victims\nand certain unknown killers. The air over and above the vast concrete river trembled with the\nwarmth of Montag's body alone; it was incredible how he felt his temperature could cause the\nwhole immediate world to vibrate. He was a phosphorescent target; he knew it, he felt it. And\nnow he must begin his little walk.\nThree blocks away a few headlights glared. Montag drew a deep breath. His lungs were like\nburning brooms in his chest. His mouth was sucked dry from running. His throat tasted of bloody\niron and there was rusted steel in his feet.\nWhat about those lights there? Once you started walking you'd have to gauge how fast those\nbeetles could make it down here. Well, how far was it to the other curb? It seemed like a hundred\nyards. Probably not a hundred, but figure for that anyway, figure that with him going very\nslowly, at a nice stroll, it might take as much as thirty seconds, forty seconds to walk all the way.\nThe beetles? Once started, they could leave three blocks behind them in about fifteen seconds.\nSo, even if halfway across he started to run . . . ?\nHe put his right foot out and then his left foot and then his right. He walked on the empty avenue.\nEven if the street were entirely empty, of course, you couldn't be sure of a safe crossing, for a car\ncould appear suddenly over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you before you had\ntaken a dozen breaths.\nHe decided not to count his steps. He looked neither to left nor right. The light from the overhead\nlamps seemed as bright and revealing as the midday sun and just as hot.\nHe listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks away on his right. Its movable\nheadlights jerked back and forth suddenly, and caught at Montag.\nKeep going.\nMontag faltered, got a grip on the books, and forced himself not to freeze. Instinctively he took a\nfew quick, running steps then talked out loud to himself and pulled up to stroll again. He was\nnow half across the street, but the roar from the beetle's engines whined higher as it put on speed.\nThe police, of course. They see me. But slow now; slow, quiet, don't turn, don't look, don't seem\nconcerned. Walk, that's it, walls, walk.\nThe beetle was rushing. The beetle was roaring. The beetle raised its speed. The beetle was\nwhining. The beetle was in high thunder. The beetle came skimming. The beetle came in a single\nwhistling trajectory, fired from an invisible rifle. It was up to 120 m.p.h. It was up to 130 at least.\nMontag clamped his jaws. The heat of the racing headlights burnt his cheeks, it seemed, and\njittered his eye-lids and flushed the sour sweat out all over his body.\nHe began to shuffle idiotically and talk to himself and then he broke and just ran. He put out his\nlegs as far as they would go and down and then far out again and down and back and out and\ndown and back. God ! God! He dropped a book, broke pace, almost turned, changed his mind,\nplunged on, yelling in concrete emptiness, the beetle scuttling after its running food, two\nhundred, one hundred feet away, ninety, eighty, seventy, Montag gasping, flailing his hands, legs\nup down out, up down out, closer, closer, hooting, calling, his eyes burnt white now as his head\njerked about to confront the flashing glare, now the beetle was swallowed in its own light, now it\nwas nothing but a torch hurtling upon him; all sound, all blare. Now-almost on top of him !\nHe stumbled and fell.\nI'm done! It's over!\nBut the falling made a difference. An instant before reaching him the wild beetle cut and\nswerved out. It was gone. Montag lay flat, his head down. Wisps of laughter trailed back to him\nwith the blue exhaust from the beetle.\nHis right hand was extended above him, flat. Across the extreme tip of his middle finger, he saw\nnow as he lifted that hand, a faint sixteenth of an inch of black tread where tyre had touched in\npassing. He looked at that black line with disbelief, getting to his feet.\nThat wasn't the police, he thought.\nHe looked down the boulevard. It was clear now. A carful of children, all ages, God knew, from\ntwelve to sixteen, out whistling, yelling, hurrahing, had seen a man, a very extraordinary sight, a man strolling, a rarity,\nand simply said, \"Let's get him,\" not knowing he was the fugitive Mr. Montag, simply a,number\nof children out for a long night of roaring five or six hundred miles in a few moonlit hours, their\nfaces icy with wind, and coming home or not coming at dawn, alive or not alive, that made the\nadventure.\nThey would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in\ndust, touching his bruised cheek. For no reason at all in the world they would have killed me.\nHe walked toward the far kerb telling each foot to go and keep going. Somehow he had picked\nup the spilled books; he didn't remember bending or touching them. He kept moving them from\nhand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure.\nI wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse?\nHe stopped and his mind said it again, very loud.\nI wonder if they were the ones who killed Clarisse!\nHe wanted to run after them yelling.\nHis eyes watered.\nThe thing that had saved him was falling flat. The driver of that car, seeing Montag down,\ninstinctively considered the probability that running over a body at that speed might turn the car\nupside down and spill them out. If Montag had remained an upright target. . . ?\nMontag gasped.\nFar down the boulevard, four blocks away, the beetle had slowed, spun about on two wheels, and\nwas now racing back, slanting over on the wrong side of the street, picking up speed.\nBut Montag was gone, hidden in the safety of the dark alley for which he had set out on a long\njourney, an hour or was it a minute, ago? He stood shivering in the night, looking back out as the\nbeetle ran by and skidded back to the centre of the avenue, whirling laughter in the air all about\nit, gone.\nFurther on, as Montag moved in darkness, he could see the helicopters falling, falling, like the\nfirst flakes of snow in the long winter. to come....\nThe house was silent.\nMontag approached from the rear, creeping through a thick night-moistened scent of daffodils\nand roses and wet grass. He touched the screen door in back, found it open, slipped in, moved\nacross the porch, listening.\nMrs. Black, are you asleep in there? he thought. This isn't good, but your husband did it to others\nand never asked and never wondered and never worried. And now since you're a fireman's wife,\nit's your house and your turn, for all the houses your husband burned and the people he hurt\nwithout thinking. .\nThe house did not reply.\nHe hid the books in the kitchen and moved from the house again to the alley and looked back\nand the house was still dark and quiet, sleeping.\nOn his way across town, with the helicopters fluttering like torn bits of paper in the sky, he\nphoned the alarm at a lonely phone booth outside a store that was closed for the night. Then he\nstood in the cold night air, waiting and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run, and\nthe Salamanders coming, coming to bum Mr. Black's house while he was away at work, to make\nhis wife stand shivering in the morning air while the roof let go and dropped in upon the fire. But\nnow, she was still asleep.\nGood night, Mrs. Black, he thought. -\n\"Faber! \"\nAnother rap, a whisper, and a long waiting. Then, after a minute, a small light flickered inside\nFaber's small house. After another pause, the back door opened.\nThey stood looking at each other in the half-light, Faber and Montag, as if each did not believe in\nthe other's existence. Then Faber moved and put out his hand and grabbed Montag and moved\nhim in and sat him down and went back and stood in the door, listening. The sirens were wailing\noff in the morning distance. He came in and shut the door.\nMontag said, \"I've been a fool all down the line. I can't stay long. I'm on my way God knows\nwhere.\"\n\"At least you were a fool about the right things,\" said Faber. \"I thought you were dead. The\naudio-capsule I gave you--\"\n\"Burnt.\"\n\"I heard the captain talking to you and suddenly there was nothing. I almost came out looking for\nyou.\"\n\"The captain's dead. He found the audio-capsule, he heard your voice, he was going to trace it. I\nkilled him with the flamethrower.\"\nFaber sat down and did not speak for a time.\n\"My God, how did this happen?\" said Montag. \"It was only the other night everything was fine\nand the next thing I know I'm drowning. How many times can a man go down and still be alive?\nI can't breathe. There's Beatty dead, and he was my friend once, and there's Millie gone, I\nthought she was my wife, but now I don't know. And the house all burnt. And my job gone and\nmyself on the run, and I planted a book in a fireman's house on the way. Good Christ, the things\nI've done in a single week! \"\n\"You did what you had to do. It was coming on for a long time.\"\n\"Yes, I believe that, if there's nothing else I believe. It saved itself up to happen. I could feel it\nfor a long time, I was saving something up, I went around doing one thing and feeling another.\nGod, it was all there. It's a wonder it didn't show on me, like fat. And now here I am, messing up\nyour life. They might follow me here.\"\n\"I feel alive for the first time in years,\" said Faber. \"I feel I'm doing what I should have done a\nlifetime ago. For a little while I'm not afraid. Maybe it's because I'm doing the right thing at last.\nMaybe it's because I've done a rash thing and don't want to look the coward to you. I suppose I'll\nhave to do even more violent things, exposing myself so I won't fall down on the job and turn\nscared again. What are your plans?\"\n\"To keep running.\"\n\"You know the war's on?\"\n\"I heard.\"\n\"God, isn't it funny?\" said the old man. \"It seems so remote because we have our own troubles.\"\n\"I haven't had time to think.\" Montag drew out a hundred dollars. \"I want this to stay with you,\nuse it any way that'll help when I'm gone.\"\n\"But-- \"\n\"I might be dead by noon; use this.\"\nFaber nodded. \"You'd better head for the river if you can, follow along it, and if you can hit the\nold railroad lines going out into the country, follow them. Even though practically everything's\nairborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned, the rails are still there, rusting. I've\nheard there are still hobo camps all across the country, here and there; walking camps they call\nthem, and if you keep walking far enough and keep an eye peeled, they say there's lots of old\nHarvard degrees on the tracks between here and Los Angeles. Most of them are wanted and\nhunted in the cities. They survive, I guess. There aren't many of them, and I guess the\nGovernment's never considered them a great enough danger to go in and track them down. You\nmight hole up with them for a time and get in touch with me in St. Louis, I'm leaving on the five\na.m. bus this morning, to see a retired printer there, I'm getting out into the open myself, at last.\nThe money will be put to good use. Thanks and God bless you. Do you want to sleep a few\nminutes?\"\n\"I'd better run.\"\n\"Let's check.\"\nHe took Montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture frame aside, revealing a television\nscreen the size of a postal card. \"I always wanted something very small, something I could talk\nto, something I could blot out with the palm of my hand, if necessary, nothing that could shout\nme down, nothing monstrous big. So, you see.\" He snapped it on. \"Montag,\" the TV set said, and\nlit up. \"M-O-N-T-A-G.\" The name was spelled out by the voice. \"Guy Montag. Still running.\nPolice helicopters are up. A new Mechanical Hound has been brought from another district.. .\"\nMontag and Faber looked at each other.\n\". . . Mechanical Hound never fails. Never since its first use in tracking quarry has this incredible\ninvention made a mistake. Tonight, this network is proud to have the opportunity to follow the\nHound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the target...\"\nFaber poured two glasses of whisky. \"We'll need these.\"\nThey drank.\n\". . . nose so sensitive the Mechanical Hound can remember and identify ten thousand odourindexes\non ten thousand men without re-setting! \"\nFaber trembled the least bit and looked about at his house, at the walls, the door, the doorknob,\nand the chair where Montag now sat. Montag saw the look. They both looked quickly about the\nhouse and Montag felt his nostrils dilate and he knew that he was trying to track himself and his\nnose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he had made in the air of the room and the\nsweat of his hand hung from the doorknob, invisible, but as numerous as the jewels of a small\nchandelier, he was everywhere, in and on and about everything, he was a luminous cloud, a ghost\nthat made breathing once more impossible. He saw Faber stop up his own breath for fear of\ndrawing that ghost into his own body, perhaps, being contaminated with the phantom exhalations\nand odours of a running man.\n\"The Mechanical Hound is now landing by helicopter at the site of the Burning!\"\nAnd there on the small screen was the burnt house, and the crowd, and something with a sheet\nover it and out of the sky, fluttering, came the helicopter like a grotesque flower.\nSo they must have their game out, thought Montag. The circus must go on, even with war\nbeginning within the hour....\nHe watched the scene, fascinated, not wanting to move. It seemed so remote and no part of him;\nit was a play apart and separate, wondrous to watch, not without its strange pleasure. That's all\nfor me, you thought, that's all taking place just for me, by God.\nIf he wished, he could linger here, in comfort, and follow the entire hunt on through its swift.\nphases, down alleys across streets, over empty running avenues, crossing lots and playgrounds,\nwith pauses here or there for the necessary commercials, up other alleys to the burning house of\nMr. and Mrs. Black, and so on finally to this house with Faber and himself seated, drinking,\nwhile the Electric Hound snuffed down the last trail, silent as a drift of death itself, skidded to a\nhalt outside that window there. Then, if he wished, Montag might rise, walk to the window, keep\none eye on the TV screen, open the window, lean out, look back, and see himself dramatized,\ndescribed, made over, standing there, limned in the bright small television screen from outside, a\ndrama to be watched objectively, knowing that in other parlours he was large as life, in full\ncolour, dimensionally perfect! And if he kept his eye peeled quickly he would see himself, an\ninstant before oblivion, being punctured for the benefit of how many civilian parlour-sitters who\nhad been wakened from sleep a few minutes ago by the frantic sirening of their living-room\nwalls to come watch the big game, the hunt, the one-man carnival.\nWould he have time for a speech? As the Hound seized him, in view of ten or twenty or thirty\nmillion people, mightn't he sum up his entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word\nthat would stay with them long after the. Hound had turned, clenching him in its metal-plier\njaws, and trotted off in darkness, while the camera remained stationary, watching the creature\ndwindle in the distance--a splendid fade-out! What could he say in a single word, a few words,\nthat would sear all their faces and wake them up?\n\"There,\" whispered Faber.\nOut of a helicopter glided something that was not machine, not animal, not dead, not alive,\nglowing with a pale green luminosity. It stood near the smoking ruins of Montag's house and the\nmen brought his discarded flame-thrower to it and put it down under the muzzle of the Hound.\nThere was a whirring, clicking, humming.\nMontag shook his head and got up and drank the rest of his drink. \"It's time. I'm sorry about\nthis:\"\n\"About what? Me? My house? I deserve everything. Run, for God's sake. Perhaps I can delay\nthem here--\"\n\"Wait. There's no use your being discovered. When I leave, burn the spread of this bed, that I\ntouched. Burn the chair in the living room, in your wall incinerator. Wipe down the furniture\nwith alcohol, wipe the door-knobs. Burn the throwrug in the parlour. Turn the air-conditioning\non full in all the rooms and spray with moth-spray if you have it. Then, turn on your lawn\nsprinklers as high as they'll go and hose off the sidewalks. With any luck at all, we can kill the\ntrail in here, anyway..'\nFaber shook his hand. \"I'll tend to it. Good luck. If we're both in good health, next week, the\nweek after, get in touch. General Delivery, St. Louis. I'm sorry there's no way I can go with you\nthis time, by ear-phone. That was good for both of us. But my equipment was limited. You see, I\nnever thought I would use it. What a silly old man. No thought there. Stupid, stupid. So I haven't\nanother green bullet, the right kind, to put in your head. Go now!\"\n\"One last thing. Quick. A suitcase, get it, fill it with your dirtiest clothes, an old suit, the dirtier\nthe better, a shirt, some old sneakers and socks . . . .\"\nFaber was gone and back in a minute. They sealed the cardboard valise with clear tape. \"To keep\nthe ancient odour of Mr. Faber in, of course,\" said Faber sweating at the job.\nMontag doused the exterior of the valise with whisky. \"I don't want that Hound picking up two\nodours at once. May I take this whisky. I'll need it later. Christ I hope this works!\"\nThey shook hands again and, going out of the door, they glanced at the TV. The Hound was on\nits way, followed by hovering helicopter cameras, silently, silently, sniffing the great night wind.\nIt was running down the first alley.\n\"Good-bye ! \"\nAnd Montag was out the back door lightly, running with the half-empty valise. Behind him he\nheard the lawn-sprinkling system jump up, filling the dark air with rain that fell gently and then\nwith a steady pour all about, washing on the sidewalks, and draining into the alley. He carried a\nfew drops of this rain with him on his face. He thought he heard the old man call good-bye, but\nhe-wasn't certain.\nHe ran very fast away from the house, down toward the river.\nMontag ran.\nHe could feel the Hound, like autumn, come cold and dry and swift, like a wind that didn't stir\ngrass, that didn't jar windows or disturb leaf-shadows on the white sidewalks as it passed. The\nHound did not touch the world. It carried its silence with it, so you could feel the silence building\nup a pressure behind you all across town. Montag felt the pressure rising, and ran.\nHe stopped for breath, on his way to the river, to peer through dimly lit windows of wakened\nhouses, and saw the silhouettes of people inside watching their parlour walls and there on the\nwalls the Mechanical Hound, a breath of neon vapour, spidered along, here and gone, here and\ngone! Now at Elm Terrace, Lincoln, Oak, Park, and up the alley toward Faber's house.\nGo past, thought Montag, don't stop, go on, don't turn in!\nOn the parlour wall, Faber's house, with its sprinkler system pulsing in the night air.\nThe Hound paused, quivering.\nNo! Montag held to the window sill. This way! Here!\nThe procaine needle flicked out and in, out and in. A single clear drop of the stuff of dreams fell\nfrom the needle as it vanished in the Hound's muzzle.\nMontag held his breath, like a doubled fist, in his chest.\nThe Mechanical Hound turned and plunged away from Faber's house down the alley again.\nMontag snapped his gaze to the sky. The helicopters were closer, a great blowing of insects to a\nsingle light source.\nWith an effort, Montag reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched\non his run to the river; it was in actuality his own chess-game he was witnessing, move by move.\nHe shouted to give himself the necessary push away from this last house window, and the\nfascinating seance going on in there! Hell! and he was away and gone! The alley, a street, the\nalley, a street, and the smell of the river. Leg out, leg down, leg out and down. Twenty million\nMontags running, soon, if the cameras caught him. Twenty million Montags running, running\nlike an ancient flickery Keystone Comedy, cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and\nhunted, he had seen it a thousand times. Behind him now twenty million silently baying Hounds\nricocheted across parlours, three-cushion shooting from right wall to centre wall to left wall,\ngone, right wall, centre wall, left wall, gone !\nMontag jammed his Seashell to his ear.\n\"Police suggest entire population in the Elm Terrace area do as follows: Everyone in every house\nin every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot escape if\neveryone in the next minute looks from his house. Ready! \"\nOf course! Why hadn't they done it before! Why, in all the years, hadn't this game been tried!\nEveryone up, everyone out! He couldn't be missed! The only man running alone in the night city,\nthe only man proving his legs!\n\"At the count of ten now! One! Two!\"\nHe felt the city rise. Three .\nHe felt the city turn to its thousands of doors.\nFaster! Leg up, leg down !\n\"Four ! \"\nThe people sleepwalking in their hallways.\n\"Five! \"\nHe felt their hands on the doorknobs!\nThe smell of the river was cool and like a solid rain. His throat was burnt rust and his eyes were\nwept dry with running. He yelled as if this yell would jet him on, fling him the last hundred\nyards.\n\"Six, seven, eight ! \"\nThe doorknobs turned on five thousand doors. \"Nine!\"\nHe ran out away from the last row of houses, on a slope leading down to a solid moving\nblackness. \"Ten!\"\nThe doors opened.\nHe imagined thousands on thousands of faces peering into yards, into alleys, and into the sky,\nfaces hid by curtains, pale, night-frightened faces, like grey animals peering from electric caves,\nfaces with grey colourless eyes, grey tongues and grey thoughts looking out through the numb\nflesh of the face.\nBut he was at the river.\nHe touched it, just to be sure it was real. He waded in and stripped in darkness to the skin,\nsplashed his body, arms, legs, and head with raw liquor; drank it and snuffed some up his nose.\nThen he dressed in Faber's old clothes and shoes. He tossed his own clothing into the river and\nwatched it swept away. Then, holding the suitcase, he walked out in the river until there was no\nbottom and he was swept away in the dark.\nHe was three hundred yards downstream when the Hound reached the river. Overhead the great\nracketing fans of the helicopters hovered. A storm of light fell upon the river and Montag dived\nunder the great illumination as if the sun had broken the clouds. He felt the river pull him further\non its way, into darkness. Then the lights switched back to the land, the helicopters swerved over\nthe city again, as if they had picked up another trail. They were gone. The Hound was gone. Now\nthere was only the cold river and Montag floating in a sudden peacefulness, away from the city\nand the lights and the chase, away from everything.\nHe felt as if he had left a stage behind and many actors. He felt as if he had left the great seance\nand all the murmuring ghosts. He was moving from an unreality that was frightening into a\nreality that was unreal because it was new.\nThe black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills: For the first time in a\ndozen years the stars were coming out above him, in great processions of wheeling fire. He saw a\ngreat juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him.\nHe floated on his back when the valise filled and sank; the river was mild and leisurely, going\naway from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper.\nThe river was very real; it held him comfortably and gave him the time at last, the leisure, to\nconsider this month, this year, and a lifetime of years. He listened to his heart slow. His thoughts\nstopped rushing with his blood.\nHe saw the moon low in the sky now. The moon there, and the light of the moon caused by\nwhat? By the sun, of course. And what lights the sun? Its own fire. And the sun goes on, day\nafter day, burning and burning. The sun and time. The sun and time and burning. Burning. The\nriver bobbled him along gently. Burning. The sun and every clock on the earth. It all came\ntogether and became a single thing in his mind. After a long time of floating on the land and a\nshort time of floating in the river he knew why he must never burn again in his life.\nThe sun burned every day. It burned Time. The world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis\nand time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he\nburnt things with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that meant.that everything burned!\nOne of them had to stop burning. The sun wouldn't, certainly. So it looked as if it had to be\nMontag and the people he had worked with until a few short hours ago. Somewhere the saving\nand putting away had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping, one way or\nanother, in books, in records, in people's heads, any way at all so long as it was safe, free from\nmoths, silver-fish, rust and dry-rot, and men with matches. The world was full of burning of all\ntypes and sizes. Now the guild of the asbestos-weaver must open shop very soon.\nHe felt his heel bump land, touch pebbles and rocks, scrape sand. The river had moved him\ntoward shore.\nHe looked in at the great black creature without eyes or light, without shape, with only a size that\nwent a thousand miles without wanting to stop, with its grass hills and forests that were waiting\nfor him.\nHe hesitated to leave the comforting flow of the water. He expected the Hound there. Suddenly\nthe trees might blow under a great wind of helicopters.\nBut there was only the normal autumn wind high up, going by like another river. Why wasn't the\nHound running? Why had the search veered inland? Montag listened. Nothing. Nothing.\nMillie, he thought. All this country here. Listen to it! Nothing and nothing. So much silence,\nMillie, I wonder how you'd take it? Would you shout Shut up, shut up! Millie, Millie. And he\nwas sad.\nMillie was not here and the Hound was not here, but the dry smell of hay blowing from some\ndistant field put Montag on the land. He remembered a farm he had visited when he was very\nyoung, one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere behind the seven veils of\nunreality, beyond the walls of parlours and beyond the tin moat of the city, cows chewed grass\nand pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and dogs barked after white sheep on a hill.\nNow, the dry smell of hay, the motion of the waters, made him think of sleeping in fresh hay in a\nlonely barn away from the loud highways, behind a quiet farmhouse, and under an ancient\nwindmill that whirred like the sound of the passing years overhead. He lay in the high barn loft\nall night, listening to distant animals and insects and trees, the little motions and stirrings.\nDuring the night, he thought, below the loft, he would hear a sound like feet moving, perhaps. He\nwould tense and sit up. The sound would move away, He would lie back and look out of the loft\nwindow, very late in the night, and see the lights go out in the farmhouse itself, until a very\nyoung and beautiful woman would sit in an unlit window, braiding her hair. It would be hard to\nsee her, but her face would be like the face of the girl so long ago in his past now, so very long\nago, the girl who had known the weather and never been burned by the fire-flies, the girl who\nhad known what dandelions meant rubbed off on your chin. Then, she would be gone from the\nwarm window and appear again upstairs in her moon-whitened room. And then, to the sound of\ndeath, the sound of the jets cutting the sky into two black pieces beyond the horizon, he would lie\nin the loft, hidden and safe, watching those strange new stars over the rim of the earth, fleeing\nfrom the soft colour of dawn.\nIn the morning he would not have needed sleep, for all the warm odours and sights of a complete\ncountry night would have rested and slept him while his eyes were wide and his mouth, when he\nthought to test it, was half a smile.\nAnd there at the bottom of the hayloft stair, waiting for him, would be the incredible thing. He\nwould step carefully down, in the pink light of early morning, so fully aware of the world that he\nwould be afraid, and stand over the small miracle and at last bend to touch it.\nA cool glass of fresh milk, and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of the steps.\nThis was all he wanted now. Some sign that the immense world would accept him and give him\nthe long time needed to think all the things that must be thought.\nA glass of milk, an apple, a pear.\nHe stepped from the river.\nThe land rushed at him, a tidal wave. He was crushed by darkness and the look of the country\nand the million odours on a wind that iced his body. He fell back under the breaking curve of\ndarkness and sound and smell, his ears roaring. He whirled. The stars poured over his sight like\nflaming meteors. He wanted to plunge in the river again and let it idle him safely on down\nsomewhere. This dark land rising was like that day in his childhood, swimming, when from\nnowhere the largest wave in the history of remembering slammed him down in salt mud and\ngreen darkness, water burning mouth and nose, retching his stomach, screaming! Too much\nwater!\nToo much land!\nOut of the black wall before him, a whisper. A shape. In the shape, two eyes. The night looking\nat him. The forest, seeing him.\nThe Hound!\nAfter all the running and rushing and sweating it out and half-drowning, to come this far, work\nthis hard, and think yourself safe and sigh with relief and come out on the land at last only to find\n. . .\nThe Hound!\nMontag gave one last agonized shout as if this were too much for any man.\nThe shape exploded away. The eyes vanished. The leafpiles flew up in a dry shower.\nMontag was alone in the wilderness.\nA deer. He smelled the heavy musk-like perfume mingled with blood and the gummed\nexhalation of the animal's breath, all cardamon and moss and ragweed odour in this huge night\nwhere the trees ran at him, pulled away, ran, pulled away, to the pulse of the heart behind his\neyes.\nThere must have been a billion leaves on the land; he waded in them, a dry river smelling of hot\ncloves and warm dust. And the other smells! There was a smell like a cut potato from all the\nland, raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night. There was a smell\nlike pickles from a bottle and a smell like parsley on the table at home. There was a faint yellow\nodour like mustard from a jar. There was a smell like carnations from the yard next door. He put\ndown his hand and felt a weed rise up like a child brushing him. His fingers smelled of liquorice.\nHe stood breathing, and the more he breathed the land in, the more he was filled up with all the\ndetails of the land. He was not empty. There was more than enough here to fill him. There would\nalways be more than enough.\nHe walked in the shallow tide of leaves, stumbling.\nAnd in the middle of the strangeness, a familiarity.\nHis foot hit something that rang dully.\nHe moved his hand on the ground, a yard this way, a yard that.\nThe railroad track.\nThe track that came out of the city and rusted across the land, through forests and woods,\ndeserted now, by the river.\nHere was the path to wherever he was going. Here was the single familiar thing, the magic charm\nhe might need a little while, to touch, to feel beneath his feet, as he moved on into the bramble\nbushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching, among the whispers and the blowing\ndown of leaves.\nHe walked on the track.\nAnd he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single fact he could not prove.\nOnce, long ago, Clarisse had walked here, where he was walking now.\nHalf an hour later, cold, and moving carefully on the tracks, fully aware of his entire body, his\nface, his mouth, his eyes stuffed with blackness, his ears stuffed with sound, his legs prickled\nwith burrs and nettles, he saw the fire ahead.\nThe fire was gone, then back again, like a winking eye. He stopped, afraid he might blow the fire\nout with a single breath. But the fire was there and he approached warily, from a long way off. It\ntook the better part of fifteen minutes before he drew very close indeed to it, and then he stood\nlooking at it from cover. That small motion, the white and red colour, a strange fire because it\nmeant a different thing to him.\nIt was not burning; it was warming!\nHe saw many hands held to its warmth, hands without arms, hidden in darkness. Above the\nhands, motionless faces that were only moved and tossed and flickered with firelight. He hadn't\nknown fire could look this way. He had never thought in his life that it could give as well as take.\nEven its smell was different.\nHow long he stood he did not know, but there was a foolish and yet delicious sense of knowing\nhimself as an animal come from the forest, drawn by the fire. He was a thing of brush and liquid\neye, of fur and muzzle and hoof, he was a thing of horn and blood that would smell like autumn\nif you bled it out on the ground. He stood a long long time, listening to the warm crackle of the\nflames.\nThere was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was in the men's faces, and time\nwas there, time enough to sit by this rusting track under the trees, and look at the world and turn\nit over with the eyes, as if it were held to the centre of the bonfire, a piece of steel these men\nwere all shaping. It was not only the fire that was different. It was the silence. Montag moved\ntoward this special silence that was concerned with all of the world.\nAnd then the voices began and they were talking, and he could hear nothing of what the voices\nsaid, but the sound rose and fell quietly and the voices were turning the world over and looking\nat it; the voices knew the land and the trees and the city which lay down the track by the river.\nThe voices talked of everything, there was nothing they could not talk about, he knew from the\nvery cadence and motion and continual stir of curiosity and wonder in them.\nAnd then one of the men looked up and saw him, for the first or perhaps the seventh time, and a\nvoice called to Montag:\n\"All right, you can come out now ! \"\nMontag stepped back into the shadows.\n\"It's all right,\" the voice said. \"You're welcome here.\"\nMontag walked slowly toward the fire and the five old men sitting there dressed in dark blue\ndenim pants and jackets and dark blue suits. He did not know what to say to them.\n\"Sit down,\" said the man who seemed to be the leader of the small group. \"Have some coffee?\"\nHe watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin cup, which was handed him\nstraight off. He sipped it gingerly and felt them looking at him with curiosity. His lips were\nscalded, but that was good. The faces around him were bearded, but the beards were clean, neat,\nand their hands were clean. They had stood up as if to welcome a guest, and now they sat down\nagain. Montag sipped. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"Thanks very much.\"\n\"You're welcome, Montag. My name's Granger.\" He held out a small bottle of colourless fluid.\n\"Drink this, too. It'll change the chemical index of your perspiration. Half an hour from now\nyou'll smell like two other people. With the Hound after you, the best thing is Bottoms up.\"\nMontag drank the bitter fluid.\n\"You'll stink like a bobcat, but that's all right,\" said Granger.\n\"You know my name;\" said Montag.\nGranger nodded to a portable battery TV set by the fire.\n\"We've watched the chase. Figured you'd wind up south along the river. When we heard you\nplunging around out in the forest like a drunken elk, we didn't hide as we usually do. We figured\nyou were in the river, when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city. Something funny\nthere. The chase is still running. The other way, though.\"\n\"The other way?\"\n\"Let's have a look.\"\nGranger snapped the portable viewer on. The picture was a nightmare, condensed, easily passed\nfrom hand to hand, in the forest, all whirring colour and flight. A voice cried:\n\"The chase continues north in the city! Police helicopters are converging on Avenue 87 and Elm\nGrove Park!\"\nGranger nodded. \"They're faking. You threw them off at the river. They can't admit it. They\nknow they can hold their audience only so long. The show's got to have a snap ending, quick! If\nthey started searching the whole damn river it might take all night. So they're sniffing for a\nscape-goat to end things with a bang. Watch. They'll catch Montag in the next five minutes! \"\n\"But how--\"\n\"Watch.\"\nThe camera, hovering in the belly of a helicopter, now swung down at an empty street.\n\"See that?\" whispered Granger. \"It'll be you; right up at the end of that street is our victim. See\nhow our camera is coming in? Building the scene. Suspense. Long shot. Right now, some poor\nfellow is out for a walk. A rarity. An odd one. Don't think the police don't know the habits of\nqueer ducks like that, men who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for reasons of insomnia\nAnyway, the police have had him charted for months, years. Never know when that sort of\ninformation might be handy. And today, it turns out, it's very usable indeed. It saves face. Oh,\nGod, look there!\"\nThe men at the fire bent forward.\nOn the screen, a man turned a corner. The Mechanical Hound rushed forward into the viewer,\nsuddenly. The helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that built a cage all about the\nman.\nA voice cried, \"There's Montag ! The search is done!\"\nThe innocent man stood bewildered, a cigarette burning in his hand. He stared at the Hound, not\nknowing what it was. He probably never knew. He glanced up at the sky and the wailing sirens.\nThe cameras rushed down. The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing\nthat was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as\nif to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victim's face, the\nempty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing the target.\n\"Montag, don't move!\" said a voice from the sky.\nThe camera fell upon the victim, even as did the Hound. Both reached him simultaneously. The\nvictim was seized by Hound and camera in a great spidering, clenching grip. He screamed. He\nscreamed. He screamed!\nBlackout.\nSilence.\nDarkness.\nMontag cried out in the silence and turned away.\nSilence.\nAnd then, after a time of the men sitting around the fire, their faces expressionless, an announcer\non the dark screen said, \"The search is over, Montag is dead; a crime against society has been\navenged.\"\nDarkness.\n\"We now take you to the Sky Room of the Hotel Lux for a half-hour of Just-Before-Dawn, a\nprogramme of-\"\nGranger turned it off.\n\"They didn't show the man's face in focus. Did you notice?\nEven your best friends couldn't tell if it was you. They scrambled it just enough to let the\nimagination take over. Hell,\" he whispered. \"Hell.\"\nMontag said nothing but now, looking back, sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen,\ntrembling.\nGranger touched Montag's arm. \"Welcome back from the dead.\" Montag nodded. Granger went\non. \"You might as well know all of us, now. This is Fred Clement, former occupant of the\nThomas Hardy chair at Cambridge in the years before it became an Atomic Engineering School.\nThis other is Dr. Simmons from U.C.L.A., a specialist in Ortega y Gasset; Professor West here\ndid quite a bit for ethics, an ancient study now, for Columbia University quite some years ago.\nReverend Padover here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and lost his flock between one\nSunday and the next for his views. He's been bumming with us some time now. Myself: I wrote a\nbook called The Fingers in the Glove; the Proper Relationship between the Individual and\nSociety, and here I am! Welcome, Montag! \"\n\"I don't belong with you,\" said Montag, at last, slowly. \"I've been an idiot all the way.\"\n\"We're used to that. We all made the right kind of mistakes, or we wouldn't be here. When we\nwere separate individuals, all we had was rage. I struck a fireman when he came to burn my\nlibrary years ago. I've been running ever since. You want to join us, Montag?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What have you to offer?\"\n\"Nothing. I thought I had part of the Book of Ecclesiastes and maybe a little of Revelation, but I\nhaven't even that now.\"\n\"The Book of Ecclesiastes would be fine. Where was it?\"\n\"Here,\" Montag touched his head.\n\"Ah,\" Granger smiled and nodded.\n\"What's wrong? Isn't that all right?\" said Montag.\n\"Better than all right; perfect!\" Granger turned to the Reverend. \"Do we have a Book of\nEcclesiastes?\"\n\"One. A man named Harris of Youngstown.\"\n\"Montag.\" Granger took Montag's shoulder firmly. \"Walk carefully. Guard your health. If\nanything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important you've\nbecome in the last minute!\"\n\"But I've forgotten!\"\n\"No, nothing's ever lost. We have ways to shake down your clinkers for you.\"\n\"But I've tried to remember!\"\n\"Don't try. It'll come when we need it. All of us have photographic memories, but spend a\nlifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there. Simmons here has worked\non it for twenty years and now we've got the method down to where we can recall anything that's\nbeen read once. Would you like, some day, Montag, to read Plato's Republic?\"\n\"Of course!\"\n\"I am Plato's Republic. Like to read Marcus Aurelius? Mr. Simmons is Marcus.\"\n\"How do you do?\" said Mr. Simmons.\n\"Hello,\" said Montag.\n\"I want you to meet Jonathan Swift, the author of that evil political book, Gulliver's Travels! And\nthis other fellow is Charles Darwin, and-this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Einstein, and\nthis one here at my elbow is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very kind philosopher indeed. Here we all\nare, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and\nThomas Love Peacock and Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are also\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\"\nEveryone laughed quietly.\n\"It can't be,\" said Montag.\n\"It is,\" replied Granger, smiling. \" We're book-burners, too. We read the books and burnt them,\nafraid they'd be found. Micro-filming didn't pay off; we were always travelling, we didn't want to\nbury the film and come back later. Always the chance of discovery. Better to keep it in the old\nheads, where no one can see it or suspect it. We are all bits and pieces of history and literature\nand international law, Byron, Tom Paine, Machiavelli, or Christ, it's here. And the hour is late.\nAnd the war's begun. And we are out here, and the city is there, all wrapped up in its own coat of\na thousand colours. What do you think, Montag?\"\n\"I think I was blind trying to do things my way, planting books in firemen's houses and sending\nin alarms.\"\n\"You did what you had to do. Carried out on a national scale, it might have worked beautifully.\nBut our way is simpler and, we think, better. All we want to do is keep the knowledge we think\nwe will need, intact and safe. We're not out to incite or anger anyone yet. For if we are destroyed,\nthe knowledge is dead, perhaps for good. We are model citizens, in our own special way; we\nwalk the old tracks, we lie in the hills at night, and the city people let us be. We're stopped and\nsearched occasionally, but there's nothing on our persons to incriminate us. The organization is\nflexible, very loose, and fragmentary. Some of us have had plastic surgery on our faces and\nfingerprints. Right now we have a horrible job; we're waiting for the war to begin and, as\nquickly, end. It's not pleasant, but then we're not in control, we're the odd minority crying in the\nwilderness. When the war's over, perhaps we can be of some use in the world.\"\n\"Do you really think they'll listen then?\"\n\"If not, we'll just have to wait. We'll pass the books on to our children, by word of mouth, and let\nour children wait, in turn, on the other people. A lot will be lost that way, of course.\nBut you can't make people listen. They have to come round in their own time, wondering what\nhappened and why the world blew up under them. It can't last.\"\n\"How many of you are there?\"\n\"Thousands on the roads, the abandoned railtracks, tonight, bums on the outside, libraries inside.\nIt wasn't planned, at first. Each man had a book he wanted to remember, and did. Then, over a\nperiod of twenty years or so, we met each other, travelling, and got the loose network together\nand set out a plan. The most important single thing we had to pound into ourselves was that we\nwere not important, we mustn't be pedants; we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the\nworld. We're nothing more than dust-jackets for books, of no significance otherwise. Some of us\nlive in small towns. Chapter One of Thoreau's Walden in Green River, Chapter Two in Willow\nFarm, Maine. Why, there's one town in Maryland, only twenty-seven people, no bomb'll ever\ntouch that town, is the complete essays of a man named Bertrand Russell. Pick up that town,\nalmost, and flip the pages, so many pages to a person. And when the war's over, some day, some\nyear, the books can be written again, the people will be called in, one by one, to recite what they\nknow and we'll set it up in type until another Dark Age, when we might have to do the whole\ndamn thing over again. But that's the wonderful thing about man; he never gets so discouraged or\ndisgusted that he gives up doing it all over again, because he knows very well it is important and\nworth the doing.\"\n\"What do we do tonight?\" asked Montag.\n\"Wait,\" said Granger. \"And move downstream a little way, just in case.\"\nHe began throwing dust and dirt on the fire.\nThe other men helped, and Montag helped, and there, in the wilderness, the men all moved their\nhands, putting out the fire together.\nThey stood by the river in the starlight.\nMontag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof. Five. Five o'clock in the morning. Another year\nticked by in a single hour, and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river.\n\"Why do you trust me?\" said Montag.\nA man moved in the darkness.\n\"The look of you's enough. You haven't seen yourself in a mirror lately. Beyond that, the city has\nnever cared so much about us to bother with an elaborate chase like this to find us. A few\ncrackpots with verses in their heads can't touch them, and they know it and we know it; everyone\nknows it. So long as the vast population doesn't wander about quoting the Magna Charta and the\nConstitution, it's all right. The firemen were enough to check that, now and then. No, the cities\ndon't bother us. And you look like hell.\"\nThey moved along the bank of the river, going south. Montag tried to see the men's faces, the old\nfaces he remembered from the firelight, lined and tired. He was looking for a brightness, a\nresolve, a triumph over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there. Perhaps he had expected their\nfaces to burn and glitter with the knowledge they carried, to glow as lanterns glow, with the light\nin them. But all the light had come from the camp fire, and these men had seemed no different\nfrom any others who had run a long race, searched a long search, seen good things destroyed,\nand now, very late, were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the blowing out of the\nlamps. They weren't at all certain that the things they carried in their heads might make every\nfuture dawn glow with a purer light, they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file\nbehind their quiet eyes, the books were waiting, with their pages uncut, for the customers who\nmight come by in later years, some with clean and some with dirty fingers.\nMontag squinted from one face to another as they walked.\n\"Don't judge a book by its cover,\" someone said.\nAnd they all laughed quietly, moving downstream.\nThere was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long before the men looked up.\nMontag stared back at the city, far down the river, only a faint glow now.\n\"My wife's back there.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that. The cities won't do well in the next few days,\" said Granger.\n\"It's strange, I don't miss her, it's strange I don't feel much of anything,\" said Montag. \"Even if\nshe dies, I realized a moment ago, I don't think I'll feel sad. It isn't right. Something must be\nwrong with me.\"\n\"Listen,\" said Granger, taking his arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him\npass. \"When I was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. He was also a very kind\nman who had a lot of love to give the world, and he helped clean up the slum in our town; and he\nmade toys for us and he did a million things in his lifetime; he was always busy with his hands.\nAnd when he died, I suddenly realized I wasn't crying for him at all, but for the things he did. I\ncried because he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of wood or\nhelp us raise doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the violin the way he did, or tell us jokes\nthe way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all the actions stopped dead and there was\nno one to do them just the way he did. He was individual. He was an important man. I've never\ngotten over his death. Often I think, what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he\ndied. How many jokes are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by\nhis hands. He shaped the world. He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted of ten\nmillion fine actions the night he passed on.\"\nMontag walked in silence. \"Millie, Millie,\" he whispered. \"Millie.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"My wife, my wife. Poor Millie, poor Millie. I can't remember anything. I think of her hands but\nI don't see them doing anything at all. They just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her\nlap or there's a cigarette in them, but that's all.\"\nMontag turned and glanced back.\nWhat did you give to the city, Montag?\nAshes.\nWhat did the others give to each other?\nNothingness.\nGranger stood looking back with Montag. \"Everyone must leave something behind when he dies,\nmy grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes\nmade. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere\nto go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there. It\ndoesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before\nyou touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. The difference\nbetween the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawncutter\nmight just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.\"\nGranger moved his hand. \"My grandfather showed me some V-2 rocket films once, fifty years\nago. Have you ever seen the atom-bomb mushroom from two hundred miles up? It's a pinprick,\nit's nothing. With the wilderness all around it.\n\"My grandfather ran off the V-2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our\ncities would open up and let the green and the land and the wilderness in more, to remind people\nthat we're allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness that can take back\nwhat it has given, as easily as blowing its breath on us or sending the sea to tell us we are not so\nbig. When we forget how close the wilderness is in the night, my grandpa said, some day it will\ncome in and get us, for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be. You see?\" Granger\nturned to Montag. \"Grandfather's been dead for all these years, but if you lifted my skull, by\nGod, in the convolutions of my brain you'd find the big ridges of his thumbprint. He touched me.\nAs I said earlier, he was a sculptor. 'I hate a Roman named Status Quo!' he said to me. 'Stuff your\neyes with wonder,' he said, 'live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It's more\nfantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security,\nthere never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which\nhangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,' he said,\n'shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.'\"\n\"Look!\" cried Montag.\nAnd the war began and ended in that instant.\nLater, the men around Montag could not say if they had really seen anything. Perhaps the merest\nflourish of light and motion in the sky. Perhaps the bombs were there, and the jets, ten miles, five\nmiles, one mile up, for the merest instant, like grain thrown over the heavens by a great sowing\nhand, and the bombs drifting with dreadful swiftness, yet sudden slowness, down upon the\nmorning city they had left behind. The bombardment was to all intents and purposes finished,\nonce the jets had sighted their target, alerted their bombardiers at five thousand miles an hour; as\nquick as the whisper of a scythe the war was finished. Once the bomb-release was yanked it was\nover. Now, a full three seconds, all of the time in history, before the bombs struck, the enemy\nships themselves were gone half around the visible world, like bullets in which a savage islander\nmight not believe because they were invisible; yet the heart is suddenly shattered, the body falls\nin separate motions and the blood is astonished to be freed on the air; the brain squanders its few\nprecious memories and, puzzled, dies.\nThis was not to be believed. It was merely a gesture. Montag saw the flirt of a great metal fist\nover the far city and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow, would say, after the deed,\ndisintegrate, leave no stone on another, perish. Die.\nMontag held the bombs in the sky for a single moment, with his mind and his hands reaching\nhelplessly up at them. \"Run!\" he cried to Faber. To Clarisse, \"Run!\" To Mildred, \"Get out, get\nout of there! \" But Clarisse, he remembered, was dead. And Faber was out; there in the deep\nvalleys of the country somewhere the five a.m. bus was on its way from one desolation to\nanother. Though the desolation had not yet arrived, was still in the air, it was certain as man\ncould make it. Before the bus had run another fifty yards on the highway, its destination would\nbe meaningless, and its point of departure changed from metropolis to junkyard.\nAnd Mildred . . .\nGet out, run!\nHe saw her in her hotel room somewhere now in the halfsecond remaining with the bombs a\nyard, a foot, an inch from her building. He saw her leaning toward the great shimmering walls of\ncolour and motion where the family talked and talked and talked to her, where the family prattled\nand chatted and said her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch,\nnow a half-inch, now a quarter-inch from the top of the hotel. Leaning into the wall as if all of\nthe hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless unease there. Mildred, leaning\nanxiously, nervously, as if to plunge, drop, fall into that swarming immensity of colour to drown\nin its bright happiness.\nThe first bomb struck.\n\"Mildred! \"\nPerhaps, who would ever know? Perhaps the great broadcasting stations with their beams of\ncolour and light and talk and chatter went first into oblivion.\nMontag, falling flat, going down, saw or felt, or imagined he saw or felt the walls go dark in\nMillie's face, heard her screaming, because in the millionth part of time left, she saw her own\nface reflected there, in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it was such a wildly empty face, all\nby itself in the room, touching nothing, starved and eating of itself, that at last she recognized it\nas her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted\ndown upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet\nother people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid\nitself of them in its own unreasonable way.\nI remember. Montag clung to the earth. I remember. Chicago. Chicago, a long time ago. Millie\nand I. That's where we met! I remember now. Chicago. A long time ago.\nThe concussion knocked the air across and down the river, turned the men over like dominoes in\na line, blew the water in lifting sprays, and blew the dust and made the trees above them mourn\nwith a great wind passing away south. Montag crushed himself down, squeezing himself small,\neyes tight. He blinked once. And in that instant saw the city, instead of the bombs, in the air.\nThey had displaced each other. For another of those impossible instants the city stood, rebuilt\nand unrecognizable, taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be, taller than man had built it,\nerected at last in gouts of shattered concrete and sparkles of torn metal into a mural hung like a\nreversed avalanche, a million colours, a million oddities, a door where a window should be, a top\nfor a bottom, a side for a back, and then the city rolled over and fell down dead.\nMontag, lying there, eyes gritted shut with dust, a fine wet cement of dust in his now shut mouth,\ngasping and crying, now thought again, I remember, I remember, I remember something else.\nWhat is it? Yes, yes, part of the Ecclesiastes and Revelation. Part of that book, part of it, quick\nnow, quick, before it gets away, before the shock wears off, before the wind dies. Book of\nEcclesiastes. Here. He said it over to himself silently, lying flat to the trembling earth, he said the\nwords of it many times and they were perfect without trying and there was no Denham's\nDentifrice anywhere, it was just the Preacher by himself, standing there in his mind, looking at\nhim ....\n\"There,\" said a voice.\nThe men lay gasping like fish laid out on the grass. They held to the earth as children hold to\nfamiliar things, no matter how cold or dead, no matter what has happened or will happen, their\nfingers were clawed into the dirt, and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from\nbursting, to keep their sanity from bursting, mouths open, Montag shouting with them, a protest\nagainst the wind that ripped their faces and tore at their lips, making their noses bleed.\nMontag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world. And\nlying there it seemed that he saw every single grain of dust and every blade of grass and that he\nheard every cry and shout and whisper going up in the world now. Silence fell down in the\nsifting dust, and all the leisure they might need to look around, to gather the reality of this day\ninto their senses.\nMontag looked at the river. We'll go on the river. He looked at the old railroad tracks. Or we'll go\nthat way. Or we'll walk on the highways now, and we'll have time to put things into ourselves.\nAnd some day, after it sets in us a long time, it'll come out of our hands and our mouths. And a\nlot of it will be wrong, but just enough of it will be right. We'll just start walking today and see\nthe world and the way the world walks around and talks, the way it really looks. I want to see\neverything now. And while none of it will be me when it goes in, after a while it'll all gather\ntogether inside and it'll be me. Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there,\noutside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where it's\nfinally me, where it's in the blood, where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day. I\nget hold of it so it'll never run off. I'll hold on to the world tight some day. I've got one finger on\nit now; that's a beginning.\nThe wind died.\nThe other men lay a while, on the dawn edge of sleep, not yet ready to rise up and begin the day's\nobligations, its fires and foods, its thousand details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand.\nThey lay blinking their dusty eyelids. You could hear them breathing fast, then slower, then slow\n....\nMontag sat up.\nHe did not move any further, however. The other men did likewise. The sun was touching the\nblack horizon with a faint red tip. The air was cold and smelled of a coming rain.\nSilently, Granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, swearing, swearing incessantly under his breath,\ntears dripping from his face. He shuffled down to the river to look upstream.\n\"It's flat,\" he said, a long time later. \"City looks like a heap of baking-powder. It's gone.\" And a\nlong time after that. \"I wonder how many knew it was coming? I wonder how many were\nsurprised?\"\nAnd across the world, thought Montag, how many other cities dead? And here in our country,\nhow many? A hundred, a thousand?\nSomeone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket, and\nshoved this under a bit of grass and leaves, and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet\nand sputtered but finally caught, and the fire grew larger in the early morning as the sun came up\nand the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn to the fire, awkwardly, with\nnothing to say, and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down.\nGranger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it. \"We'll have a bite. Then we'll turn around\nand walk upstream. They'll be needing us up that way.\"\nSomeone produced a small frying-pan and the bacon went into it and the frying-pan was set on\nthe fire. After a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it\nfilled the morning air with its aroma. The men watched this ritual silently.\nGranger looked into the fire. \"Phoenix.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"There was a silly damn bird called a Phoenix back before Christ: every few hundred years he\nbuilt a pyre and burned himself up. He must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he\nburnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like\nwe're doing the same thing, over and over, but we've got one damn thing the Phoenix never had.\nWe know the damn silly thing we just did. We know all the damn silly things we've done for a\nthousand years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it,\nsome day we'll stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them. We\npick up a few more people that remember, every generation.\"\nHe took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, thoughtfully.\n\"Now, let's get on upstream,\" said Granger. \"And hold on to one thought: You're not important.\nYou're not anything. Some day the load we're carrying with us may help someone. But even\nwhen we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didn't use what we got out of them. We\nwent right on insulting the dead. We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who\ndied before us. We're going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month\nand the next year. And when they ask us what we're doing, you can say, We're remembering.\nThat's where we'll win out in the long run. And some day we'll remember so much that we'll\nbuild the biggest goddam steam-shovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove\nwar in and cover it up. Come on now, we're going to go build a mirror-factory first and put out\nnothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them.\"\nThey finished eating and put out the fire. The day was brightening all about them as if a pink\nlamp had been given more wick. In the trees, the birds that had flown away now came back and\nsettled down.\nMontag began walking and after a moment found that the others had fallen in behind him, going\nnorth. He was surprised, and moved aside to let Granger pass, but Granger looked at him and\nnodded him on. Montag went ahead. He looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track\ngoing back down to where the farms lay, where the barns stood full of hay, where a lot of people\nhad walked by in the night on their way from the city. Later, in a month or six months, and\ncertainly not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep right on going\nuntil he caught up with the people.\nBut now there was a long morning's walk until noon, and if the men were silent it was because\nthere was everything to think about and much to remember. Perhaps later in the morning, when\nthe sun was up and had warmed them, they would begin to talk, or just say the things they\nremembered, to be sure they were there, to be absolutely certain that things were safe in them.\nMontag felt the slow stir of words, the slow simmer. And when it came to his turn, what could he\nsay, what could he offer on a day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is\na season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time to keep silence and a\ntime to speak. Yes, all that. But what else. What else? Something, something . . .\nAnd on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and\nyielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\nYes, thought Montag, that's the one I'll save for noon. For noon...\nWhen we reach the city."
