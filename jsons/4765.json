    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLast night I had a crazy dream\nA wish was granted just for me\nIt could be for anything\nI didn't ask for money or a mansion in Malibu\nI simply wished for one more day with you\n\n[Chorus]\nOne more day, one more time\nOne more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied\nBut then again, I know what it would do\nLeave me wishing still for one more day with you\nOne more day\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl\nI'd unplug the telephone and keep the TV off\nI'd hold you every second\nSay a million I love you's\nThat's what I'd do with one more day with you\n\n[Chorus]\nOne more day, one more time\nOne more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied\nBut then again, I know what it would do\nLeave me wishing still for one more day with you\nOne more day\nOne more day, one more time\nOne more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied\nBut then again, I know what it would do\nLeave me wishing still for one more day with you\nOne more day\n[Outro]\nLeave me wishing still for one more day\nLeave me wishing still for one more day with you\nOne more day, one more day"
