    "lyrics": "When we are dancing and your dangerously near me\nI get ideas, I get ideas\nI want to hold you so much closer than I dare to\nI want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to\nAnd when you touch me and there's fire in every finger\nI get ideas, I get ideas\nAnd after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger\nI kinda think you get ideas too\nYour eyes are always saying, the things you're never saying\nI only hope they're saying that you could love me too\nFor that's the whole idea, it's true\nThe lovely idea that I'm falling in love with you\nWhen we are dancing and your dangerously near me\nI get ideas, I get ideas\nI want to hold you so much closer than I dare to\nI want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to\nAnd when you touch me and there's fire in every finger\nI get ideas, I get ideas\nAnd after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger\nI kinda think you get ideas too\nYour eyes are always saying, the things you're never saying\nI only hope they're saying that you could love me too\nFor that's the whole idea, it's true\nThe lovely idea that I'm falling in love with you"
