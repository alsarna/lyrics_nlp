    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm shouting all about love\nWhile they treated you like a dog\nWhen you were the one who had made it so clear\nAll those years ago\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm talking all about how to give\nThey don't act with much honesty\nBut you point the way to the truth when you say\nAll you need is love\n\n[Bridge]\nLiving with good and bad\nI always looked up to you\nNow we're left cold and sad\nBy someone, the devil's best friend\nSomeone who offended all\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe're living in a bad dream\nThey've forgotten all about mankind\nAnd you were the one they backed up to the wall\nAll those years ago\nYou were the one who imagined it all\nAll those years ago\n[Instrumental Break]\nAll those years ago\nAll those years ago\n\n[Bridge]\nDeep in the darkest night\nI send out a prayer to you\nNow in the world of light\nWhere the spirit free of the lies\nAnd all else that we despised\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey've forgotten all about God\nHe's the only reason we exist\nYet you were the one that they said was so weird\nAll those years ago\nYou said it all, though not many had ears\nAll those years ago\nYou had control of our smiles and our tears\nAll those years ago\n\n[Outro]\nAll those years ago\nAll those years ago"
