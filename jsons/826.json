    "lyrics": "I'll never let you see\nThe way my broken heart is hurtin' me\nI've got my pride and I know how to hide\nAll my sorrow and pain\nI'll do my cryin' in the rain\n\nIf I wait for cloudy skies\nYou won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes\nYou'll never know that I still love you so\nThough the heartaches remain\nI'll do my cryin' in the rain\n\nRain drops fallin' from heaven\nCould never wash away my misery\nBut since we're not together\nI look for stormy weather\nTo hide these tears I hope you'll never see\n\nSome day when my cryin's done\nI'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun\nI may be a fool but till then darling you'll\nNever see me complain\nI'll do my cryin' in the rain\n\nI'll do my cryin' in the rain\nI'll do my cryin' in the rain"
