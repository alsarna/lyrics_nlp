I'll say this\n\nIt's sad to think (Yes)\nWe can do this\nWe're not gonna make it\nAnd it's gotten to the point\nWhere we just can't fake it\nFor some ungodly reason\nWe gotta work on it\nWe just won't let it die\nI guess neither one of us (Neither one of us)\nWants to be thе first to say goodbye\nWe just don't, we just don't want to\nI keep wondеring\nI keep wondering\nWhat I'm gonna do without you\nWhat I'm gonna do without you\nAnd I guess you must be\nWondering the same thing too\nSo we go on\nGo on together living a lie\nBecause neither one of us (Neither one of us)\nWants to be the first to say goodbye\n\nOh, every time I find the nerve\nEvery time I find the nerve\nTo say I'm leaving\nI can't go\nOld memories\nThose old memories get in my way\nOh, Lord knows it's only me\nOh, He knows it's only me\nThat I'm deceiving\nWhen it comes to saying goodbye\nThat's a simple word that I just cannot say\n\nThere can be no way\nThere can be no way\nThis can have a happy ending\nCan't make that note sitting down\nNo, no\nSo we just go on\nHurting and pretending\nAnd convincing ourselves\nTo give it just one more try\nBecause neither one of us (Neither one of us)\nWants to be the first to say\nNeither one of us (Neither one of us)\nWants to be the first to say\nNeither one of us (Neither one of us)\nWants to be the first to say\nFarewell, my love\nGoodbye\n\nI can't sing that song sitting down\nI can't get a note out\nOh my goodnessEmbed"
