    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBig orange ball, sinking in the water\nToes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter\nLittle umbrella shaped margaritas\nCoconut oil, tanning señoritas\nNow I know how Jimmy Buffet feels\n\nHands on the wheel, cruising down the interstate\nGas pedal sticks, carries my car away\nI was going as fast as a Rambler goes\nI could feel the speed from my head to my toes\nNow I know how Richard Petty feels\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been around the block a time or two\nDone almost everything a boy can do\nI've done some living, yeah I've had fun\nBut there is one thing that I haven't done\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaved two months, bought a little diamond\nTonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing\nDown on one knee on momma's front steps\nMan I'm going to die if she really says yes\nI want to know how forever feels\n[Chorus]\nI've been around the block a time or two\nDone almost everything a boy can do\nI've done some living, yeah I've had fun\nBut there is one thing that I haven't done\n\n[Outro]\nI want to know how forever feels\nHey, I want to know how forever feels\nGirl, I want to know how forever feels"
