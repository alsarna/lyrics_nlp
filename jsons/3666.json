    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nFor so long\nI kept these feelings for you locked up inside\nAnd there were nights that\nI would cry myself to sleep and wonder why\n\nNow I don't wanna tell you how to live\nDon't wanna put the blame\nBut don't you think\nIt's time for you and I\nTo try to make a change\n\n[Chorus:]\nWe can't go wrong\n(Loving one another)\nWe can't go wrong\n(Caring for each other)\n\nWe can't go wrong\nIf the love we have is real\nWe can't go wrong\n\n[Verse 2:]\nThere was a time when things were better\nThan the way they are today\nBut we forgot the vows we made\nAnd love got lost along the way\nNow I can tell just by the way\nYou look at me that you feel the same\nSo don't you think it's time for\nYou and I to try to make a change\n\n[Repeat Chorus x2:]\n\nWe can't go wrong\nWe can't go wrong\nWe can't go wrong\nWe can't go wrong\n\nWe can't go wrong\nWe can't go wrong\nIf the love we have is real"
