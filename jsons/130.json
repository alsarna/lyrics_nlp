    "lyrics": "Young at Heart LyricsFairy tales can come true, it can happen to you\nIf you're young at heart\nFor it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind\nIf you're young at heart\n\nYou can go to extremes with impossible schemes\nYou can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams\nAnd life gets more exciting with each passing day\nAnd love is either in your heart, or on it's way\n\nDon't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth\nTo be young at heart\nFor as rich as you are, it's much better by far\nTo be young at heart\n\nAnd if you should survive to 105\nLook at all you'll derive out of being alive\nAnd here is the best part, you have a head start\nIf you are among the very young at heart\nAnd if you should survive to 105\nLook at all you'll derive out of being alive\nAnd here is the best part, you have a head start\nIf you are among the very young at heartEmbed"
