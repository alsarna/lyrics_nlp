    "lyrics": "People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one\nAnd we've just begun\nI think I'm gonna have a son\nHe will be like him and me, as free as a dove\nConceived in love\nThe sun is gonna shine above\n\nAnd even though we ain't got money\nI'm so in love with you honey\nEverything will bring a chain of love\nAnd in the morning when I rise\nBring a tear of joy to my eyes\nAnd tell me everything's gonna be all right\n\nLove a guy who holds the world in a paper cup\nDrink it up\nLove him and he'll bring you luck\nAnd if you find he helps your mind, better take him home\nYeah, and don't you live alone\nTry to earn what lovers own\n\nAnd even though we ain't got money\nI'm so in love with you honey\nEverything will bring a chain of love\nAnd in the morning when I rise\nBring a tear of joy to my eyes\nAnd tell me everything's gonna be all right\nAnd even though we ain't got money\nI'm so in love with you honey\nEverything will bring a chain of love\nAnd in the morning when I rise\nBring a tear of joy to my eyes\nAnd tell me everything's gonna be all right"
