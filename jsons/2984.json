    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHow can I just let you walk away?\nJust let you leave without a trace\nWhen I stand here taking every breath with you? Ooh, ooh\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all\nHow can you just walk away from me\nWhen all I can do is watch you leave?\n‘Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain\nAnd even shared the tears\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all\n\n[Chorus]\nSo take a look at me now\nOh, there's just an empty space\nAnd there's nothing left here to remind me\nJust the memory of your face\nOoh, take a look at me now\nWell, there's just an empty space\nAnd you coming back to me is against the odds\nAnd that's what I've got to face\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wish I could just make you turn around\nTurn around and see me cry\nThere's so much I need to say to you, so many reasons why\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all\n[Chorus]\nSo take a look at me now\nWell, there's just an empty space\nAnd there's nothing left here to remind me\nJust the memory of your face\nNow, take a look at me now\n‘Cause there's just an empty space\nBut to wait for you is all I can do\nAnd that's what I've got to face\nTake a good look at me now\n‘Cause I'll still be standing here\nAnd you coming back to me is against all odds\nIt's the chance I've gotta take\n\n[Outro]\nTake a look at me now"
