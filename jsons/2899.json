    "lyrics": "I can see that, it won't be long\nYou grow cold when you keep holding on\nYou know you've changed\nAnd your words they lie\nThat's something you can't deny\nI call, you're not at home\nYou're home, but you're not alone\nIf you wanna leave\nThen why don't you say\nYour love has gone anyway\n\nI know there's something going on\nI know there's something going on\nI know it won't be long\nWon't be long before you're gone\nThere's something going on\nThere's something going on\n\nI know a good thing\nMust come to an end\nBut it's hard to take\nLosing a friend\nI know what you think\nAnd what's in your mind\nSo darling, why pretend?\nI know there's something going on\nI know there's something going on\nI know it won't be long\nWon't be long before you're gone\n\nThere's something going on\nThere's something going on\nI know there's something going on\nI know there's something going on\nI know it won't be long\nWon't be long before you're gone\n\nThere's something going on\nThere's something going on\nThere's something going on\nThere's something going on"
