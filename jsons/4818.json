Would you agree?\nIt's almost that feeling that we've met before\nSo tell me that you don't think I'm crazy\nWhen I tell you love has come here and now\n\n[Chorus]\nA moment like this\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\nSome people search forever for that one special kiss\nOh, I can't believe it's happening to me\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverything changes, but beauty remains\nSomething so tender, I can't explain\nWell, I may be dreamin', but 'til I awake\nCan we make this dream last forever?\nAnd I'll cherish all the love we share\n[Chorus]\nA moment like this\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\nSome people search forever for that one special kiss\nOh, I can't believe it's happening to me\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\n\n[Bridge]\nCould this be the greatest love of all?\nI wanna know that you will catch me when I fall (Fall)\nSo let me tell you this\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment...\n\n[Chorus]\nLike this\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\nSome people search forever for that one special kiss\nOh, I can't believe it's happening to me\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\n\n[Outro]\nOh, like this (A moment like)\nOh, I can't believe it's happening to me\nSome people wait a lifetime for a moment like this\nOh, like this3Embed"
