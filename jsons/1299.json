    "lyrics": "You ask me if there'll come a time\nWhen I grow tired of you\nNever, my love\n(Ah) Never, my love\n\nYou wonder if this heart of mine\nWill lose its desire for you\nNever, my love\n(Ah) Never, my love\n\nWhat makes you think love will end\nWhen you know that my whole life depends\nOn you? (On you)\n\n(Da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da da da)\n\nNever, my love\nNever, my love\n\nYou say you fear I'll change my mind\nI won't require you\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\n\nHow can you think love will end\nWhen I've asked you to spend your whole life\nWith me? (With me, with me)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\n\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)"
