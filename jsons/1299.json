(On you)\n[Verse 3]\n(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)\n(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)\nNever, my love\nNever, my love\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou say you fear I'll change my mind\nAnd I won't require you\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\n\n[Bridge 2]\nHow can you think love will end\nWhen I've asked you to spend your whole life\nWith me? (With me, with me)\n\n[Outro]\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)\nNever, my love (Never, my love)1Embed"
