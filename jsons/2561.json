    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI don't care if you never come home\nI don't mind if you just keep on\nRowing away on a distant sea\nBecause I don't love you and you don't love me\n\nYou cause a commotion when you come to town\nYou give them a smile and they melt\nHaving lovers and friends is all good and fine\nBut I don't like yours and you don't like mine\n\nLa la, la la la la la\nLa la, la la la la la\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI don't care what you do at night\nOh, and I don't care how you get your delights\nI will leave you alone, I will just let it be\nI don't love you and you don't love me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a problem. Can you relate?\nI got a woman calling love hate\nWe made a vow we'd always be friends\nHow could we know that promises end?\nLa la, la la la la la\nLa la, la la la la la\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI tried to love you for years upon years\nYou refuse to take me for real\nIt's time you saw what I want you to see\nAnd I would still love you, if you'd just love me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a problem. Can you relate?\nI got a woman calling love hate\nWe made a vow we'd always be friends\nHow could we know that promises end?\n\nLa la, la la la la la\nLa la, la la la la la"
