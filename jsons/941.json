    "lyrics": "Don't sigh a sigh for me\nDon't ever cry for me\nThis is goodbye for me\nI know we're through\nI'm Losing you\n\nLove sang it's song for me\nThen things went wrong for me\nNights are too long for me\nBecause I'm losing you\n\nOur love and our devotion\nWere deep as any ocean\nThen one day like the tide you began to change\nAnd you became a perfect stranger\n\nSomeone is holding you\nSharing the lips I knew\nI can't believe it's true\nThat I am losing you\n\nI can't believe it's true\nThat I am losing you"
