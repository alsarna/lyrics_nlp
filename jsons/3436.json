I don't know\nI just know that there's no way to fight it\nWhoa, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa\n\n[Chorus]\nIIIIIIIIIIIIII\nGet weak when I look at you, weak when we touch\nI can't speak when I look in your eyes\nIIIIIIIIIIIIII\nGet weak when you're next to me, weak from this love\nI'm in deep when I look in your eyes\nIIII get weak\nI get weak!\nI get weak!\n\n[Bridge]\nJust a kiss you can strip me defenseless\nJust a touch I completely lose control\nAll that's left of my strength is a memory\nWhoa, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa ho-ohh\n[Outro]\nIIIIIIIIIIIIII\nGet weak when I look at you, weak when we touch\nI can't speak when I look in your eye\nI I I-I\nIIIIIIIIIIIIII\nGet weak when you're next to me, weak from this love\nI can't speak when I look in your eye\nI I I-I\nIIIIIIIIIIIIII\nGet weak when you're next to me, weak from this love\nI can't speak when I look in your eye\nI I I-I\nI I I I I"
