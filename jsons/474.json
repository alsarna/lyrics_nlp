    "lyrics": "If you love me please don't tease if I can hold then let me squeeze\nMy heart goes round and round my love comes a tumblin' down\nYou leave me aaah breathless ah\nOh I shake all over honey you know why I am sure love honey it ain't no no lie\nCause when you call my name you know honey I burn like a wooden flame\nYou leave me ooh breathless ah ooh baby ooh crazy\nHoney you're much too much you know I can't love you enough\nWell it's alright to hold me tight but when you love me love me right\nOh come on baby now don't be shy this love was meant for you and I\nWind rain sleet or snow I'm gonna get you baby wherever you go\nYou have leave me aaah breathless ah\n\nWell ooh baby brrr crazy your much to much I can't love you enough\nWell it's alright to hold me tight but when you love me love me right\nAh come on baby now don't be shy this love was meant for you and I\nWind rain sleet or snow honey Jerry's gonna get you wherever you go\nYou leave me aaah breathless ah"
