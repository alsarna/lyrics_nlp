    "lyrics": "Time Passages Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIt was late in December, the sky turned to snow\nAll round the day was goin' down slow\nNight like a river beginning to flow\nI felt the beat of my mind go\nDrifting into time passages\nYears go falling in the fading light\nTime passages\nBuy me a ticket on the last train home tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nWell I'm not the kind to live in the past\nThe years run too short and the days too fast\nThe things you lean on, are the things that don't last\nWell it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these\nTime passages\nThere's something back here that you left behind\nOh, time passages\nBuy me a ticket on the last train home tonight\n[Verse 2]\nHear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn\nDon't know why you should feel\nThat there's something to learn\nIt's just a game that you play\n\n[Chorus]\nWell the picture is changing, now you're part of a crowd\nThey're laughing at something, and the music's loud\nA girl comes towards you, you once used to know\nYou reach out your hand, but you're all alone in these\nTime passages\nI know you're in there, you're just out of sight\nOh, time passages\nBuy me a ticket on the last train home tonightEmbed"
