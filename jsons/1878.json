    "lyrics": "Qué pasa people, qué pasa ...Hit me!\nOoh!\nGet on down like, unh!\nI wanna get on the good foot\nHo! Good foot\nI got to get on the good foot\n\nGoing down to the crib, let all hang out\nWhere soulful people knows what it's about\nGoing down to the crib and let it all hang out\nWhere soulful people knows what it's about\nWhere people do the sign and take your hands\nAnd dancing to the music of James Brown Band, mmm\n\nThey're dancing on the good foot\nI got to get on the good foot\nGot to do it on the good foot\nDo it with the good foot\n\nSaid the long-hair hippies and the afro Blacks\nThey all get together across the tracks\nAnd they party, HO, on the good foot\nYou know they dance on the good foot\nDance on the good foot\n\nAin't nothing going on now but the rent\nA whole lotta bills and my money's spent, mmm\nAnd that's on my bad foot, whoa, unh\nYou know my face getting short and I got the blues\nI got a funky job and i paid my dues on the good foot\nHo! On the good foot\nI got to get on the good foot\nHey! On the good foot\nGet on the good foot\nCome over!\n\nHit it, Jab\nYou got to get it\nGet it\nSharper now, unh!\nCome on, get it\nHunh!\n\nOn the good foot\nOn the good foot\nHo! On the good foot\nGet on the good foot\nOn the good foot\nOn the good foot\nHo! Get on the good foot\nOn the good foot\nBass! Bass!\n\nGet it, Jab\nGet it, Jab\nHo!\nNow bass\nPlay on it now\nCome on\nGet it\nGet it\nGet on the good foot\nOoh!\nI got to get on the good foot\nOoh!\nGet on the good foot\nHo!\nTake care of business, sister, I'm your fella"
