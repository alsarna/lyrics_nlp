    "lyrics": "Answer me, oh, my love\nJust what sin have I been guilty of?\nTell me how I came to lose your love\nPlease answer me, sweetheart\n\nYou were mine yesterday\nI believed that love was here to stay\nWon't you tell me where I've gone astray?\nPlease answer me, my love\n\nIf you're happier without me\nI'll try not to care\nBut if you still think about me\nPlease listen to my prayer\n\nYou must know I've been true\nWon't you say that we can start anew?\nIn my sorrow now I turn to you\nPlease answer me, my love\n\n(If you're happier without me)\n(I'll try not to care)\nBut if you still think about me\nPlease listen to my prayer\n\nYou must know (you must know)I've been true (I've been true)\nWon't you say that we can start anew?\nIn my sorrow now I turn to you\nPlease answer me, my love\nAnswer me, my love"
