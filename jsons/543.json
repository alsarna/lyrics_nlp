    "lyrics": "Living is a dream when you make it seem enchanted\nLovers take for granted all the world's aglow, they ought to know\nWhen you touch a star then you really are enchanted\nFind a seed and plant it, love will make it grow\n\nIt's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover\nAnd thrill to the wonders of night\nAnd days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover\nYour dreams run to dreams in continuous flight\n\nLove is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted\nWhen your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes\n\nIt's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover\nAnd thrill to the wonders of night\nAnd days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover\nYour dreams run to dreams in continuous flight\n\nLove is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted\nWhen your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes"
