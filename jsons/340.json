    "lyrics": "Happy, happy birthday, baby\nAlthough you're with somebody new\nThought I'd drop a line to say that I wish this happy day would find me beside you\n\nHappy, happy birthday, baby\nNo, I can't call you my baby\nSeems like years ago we met on a day I can't forget 'cause that's when we fell in love\n\nDo you remember the names we had for each other?\nI was your pretty, you were my baby\nHow could we say goodbye?\n\nHope I didn't spoil your birthday\nI'm not acting like a lady\nSo I close this note to you with good luck and wishes true\nHappy, happy birthday, baby"
