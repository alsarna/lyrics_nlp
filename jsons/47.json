    "lyrics": "There once was a farmer who took a young miss\nIn back of the barn where he gave her a\nLecture on horses and chickens and eggs\nAnd told her that she has such beautiful\nManners that suited a girl of her charms\nA girl that he'd like for to take in his\nWashing and ironing, and then if she did\nThey could get married and raise lots of\n\n[Chorus]\nSweet violets, sweeter than the roses\nCovered all over from head to toe\nCovered all over with sweet violets\n\nThe girl told the farmer that he'd better stop\nAnd she told her father and called a\nTaxi which got there before very long\nFor someone was doing his little girl\nRight for a change, and so here's what he said:\n\"If you marry her, son, you're better off\nSingle 'cause it's always been my belief\nMarriage can bring a man nothing but\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe farmer decided he'd wed anyway\nAnd started in planning for his wedding\nSuit which he'd purchased for only one buck\nBut then he found out he was just out of\nMoney and so he got left in the lurch\nStanding and waiting in front of the\nEnd of this story, which just goes to show\nAll a girl wants from a man is his\n[Chorus]"
