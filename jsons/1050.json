    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAnyone who ever loved\nCould look at me\nAnd know that I love you\nAnyone who ever dreamed\nCould look at me\nAnd know I dream of you\n\n[Chorus]\nKnowing I love you so\nAnyone who had a heart\nWould take me in his arms and love me, too\nYou couldn't really have a heart\nAnd hurt me like you hurt me\nAnd be so untrue\nWhat am I to do?\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery time you go away\nI always say\n\"This time it's goodbye, dear\"\nLoving you the way I do\nI take you back\nWithout you I'd die, dear\n\n[Chorus x2]"
