    "lyrics": "If I give my heart to you\nWill you handle it with care\nWill you always treat me tenderly\nAnd in every way be fair\n\nIf I give my heart to you\nWill you give me all your love\nWill you swear that you'll be true to me\nBy the light that shines above\n\nAnd will you sigh with me when I'm sad\nSmile with me when I'm glad\nAnd always be as you are with me tonight\n\nThink it over and be sure\nPlease don't answer till you do\nWhen you promise all those things to me\nThen I'll give my heart to you\n\nAnd will you sigh with me when I'm sad\nSmile with me when I'm glad\nAnd always be as you are with me tonight\n\nThink it over and be sure\nPlease don't answer till you do\nWhen you promise all those things to me\nThen I'll give my heart to you"
