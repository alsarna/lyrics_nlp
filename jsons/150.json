    "lyrics": "It's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nWhen your true lover comes your way\nIt's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nThe poets say\nThe story goes that once a cherry tree\nBeside an apple tree did grow\nAnd there a boy once met his bride to be\nLong long ago\nThe boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall\nThe breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall\nAnd as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find\nThe branches of the two trees were intertwined\nAnd that is why the poets always write\nIf there's a new moon bright above\nIt's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nWhen you're in love"
