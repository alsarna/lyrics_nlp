Yeah...\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause nothing lasts forever\nAnd we both know hearts can change\nAnd it's hard to hold a candle\nIn the cold November rain\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe've been through this such a long, long time\nJust tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah\nBut lovers always come and lovers always go\nAnd no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away\nIf we could take the time to lay it on the line\nI could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, if you want to love me\nThen, darlin', don't refrain\nOr I'll just end up walkin'\nIn the cold November rain\n[Refrain]\nDo you need some time on your own?\nDo you need some time all alone?\nOoh, everybody needs some time on their own\nOoh, don't you know you need some time all alone?\n\n[Bridge]\nI know it's hard to keep an open heart\nWhen even friends seem out to harm you\nBut if you could heal a broken heart\nWouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah\n[Guitar Solo 1]\n\n[Refrain]\nSometimes, I need some time on my own\nSometimes, I need some time all alone\nOoh, everybody needs some time on their own\nOoh, don't you know you need some time all alone?\n[Guitar Solo 2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd when your fears subside\nAnd shadows still remain, ooh yeah\nI know that you can love me\nWhen there's no one left to blame\n[Chorus]\nSo, never mind the darkness\nWe still can find a way\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever\nEven cold November rain\n[Guitar Solo 3]\n\n[Outro]\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody\nYou're not the only one, you're not the only one\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody\nYou're not the only one, you're not the only one\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody\nYou're not the only one, you're not the only one\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody"
