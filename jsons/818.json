    "lyrics": "Theme From Dr. Kildare LyricsThree stars will shine tonight, one for the lonely\nThat star will shine its light each time that someone sighs\nThree stars for all to see, one for young lovers\nThat star was made to be the sparkle in their eyes\nAnd, for the third star, only one reason\nA star you can wish on to make dreams come true\nHigh in the sky above, three stars are shining\nI hope that star of love will shine down on youEmbed"
