    "lyrics": "The song came and went\nLike the times that we spent\nHiding out from the rain under the carnival tent\nI laughed and she'd smile\nIt would last for awhile\nYou don't know what you've got till you lose it all again\nListen to the mandolin rain\nListen to the music on the lake\nOh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away\nOh, listen to the banjo wind\nA sad song drifting low\nListen to the tears roll\nDown my face as she turns to go\nA cool evening dance\nListenin' to the bluegrass band takes the chill\nFrom the air until they play the last song\nI'll do my time\nOh, keeping you off my mind but there's moments\nThat I find, I'm not feeling so strong\nListen to the mandolin rain\nListen to the music on the lake\nAh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away\nOh, listen to the banjo wind\nA sad song drifting low\nListen to the tears roll\nDown my face as she turns to go\nRunnin' down by the lakeshore\nShe did love the sound of a summer storm\nIt played on the lake like a mandolin\nNow it's washing her away once again...whoa, again\n\nThe boat's steaming in\nOh, I watch the sidewheel spin\nAnd I think about her when I hear that whistle blow\nI can't change my mind\nOh, I knew all the time that she'd go\nBut that's a choice I made long ago\n\nListen to the mandolin rain\nListen to the music on the lake\nAh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away\nOh, listen to the banjo wind\nA sad song drifting low\nListen to the tears roll\nDown my face as she turns to go\nAs she turns to go\nListen to the...listen to the mandolin rain\n\nListen to the tears roll\nDown my face as she turns to go\nListen to the tears roll\nDown my face as she turns to go\nListen to the mandolin rain"
