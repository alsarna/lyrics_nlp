    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou act like you were just born tonight\nFace down in a memory but feeling all right\nSo who does your past belong to today?\nBaby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way\nThe girls in the bars thinking, \"who is this guy?\"\nBut they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies\nYou look so careless when they're shooting that bull\nDon't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full?\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache\nSee what else your old heart can take\nThe boys say, \"when is he gonna give us some room?\"\nThe girls say, \"God, I hope he comes back soon\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody's talking, but you don't hear a thing\nYou're still uptown on your downhill swing\nBoulevard's empty, why don't you come around?\nBaby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?\nThere's plenty of dives to be someone you're not\nYou say you're looking for something you might've forgot\nDon't bother calling to say you're leaving alone\n'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home\n[Chorus]\nTell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache\nSee what else your old heart can take\nThe boys say, \"when is he gonna give us some room?\"\nThe girls say, \"God, I hope he comes back soon\"\n\nTell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache\nSee what else your old heart can take\nThe boys say, \"when is he gonna give us some room?\"\nThe girls say, \"God, I hope he comes back soon\""
