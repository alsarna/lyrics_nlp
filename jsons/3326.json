    "lyrics": "In Too Deep LyricsAll that time I was searching with nowhere to run to\nIt started me thinking, wondering\nWhat I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting\nAsking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers\n\nCrying at the top of my voice and no one listening\nAll this time, I still remember everything you said\nThere's so much you promised, how could I ever forget\n\n[Chorus]\nListen, you know I love you but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to but I'm in too deep\n\nSo listen, listen to me\nOoh, you must believe me\nI can feel your eyes go through me\nBut I don't know why\nOoh, I know you're going but I can't believe\nIt's the way that you're leaving\nIt's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault\nI gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to\n\nI thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you\nAll this time, I still remember everything you said, oh\nThere's so much you promised, how could I ever forget\n\n[Chorus]\nListen, you know I love you but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to but I'm in too deep\nSo listen, listen to me\nI can feel your eyes go through me\n\nIt seems I've spent too long\nOnly thinking about myself, oh\nNow I want to spend my life\nJust caring bout somebody else\n\n[Chorus]\nListen, you know I love you but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to but I'm in too deep\nYou know I love you but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to but I'm in too deep\nYou know I love you but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to but I'm in too deep\nYou know I love you but I just can't take this2Embed"
