Just an ordinary guy\nTryin' hard to win me first prize\n\n[Chorus]\nWoh-oh, Candida, we could make it together\nThe further from here, girl, the better\nWhere the air is fresh and clean\nHmm-hmm, Candida, just take my hand and I'll lead ya\nI promise life will be sweeter, and it says so in my dreams\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe future is bright, the gypsy told me so last night\nSaid she saw our children playin' in the sunshine\n[Bridge 2]\nAnd there was you and I, in a house, baby, no lie\nAnd all these things were yours, and they were mine\n\n[Chorus]\nWoh, my Candida, we could make it together\nThe further from here girl the better\nWhere the air is fresh and clean\nHmm-hmm, Candida, just take my hand and I'll lead ya\nI promise life will be sweeter, and it says so in my dreams\n\n[Bridge 1]\nAnd oh, who am I? Just an ordinary guy\nYou know I'm tryin' hard to win me, first prize\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, my Candida, we could make it together\nThe further from here girl the better\nWhere the air is fresh and clean (come with me)\nWoh, (come with me), my Candida\nJust take my hand and I'll lead ya\nI promise life will be sweeter, and it says so in my [fade]Embed"
