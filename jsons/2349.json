    "lyrics": "Lost and all alone\nI always thought\nThat I could make it on my own\n\nSince you left\nI hardly make it through the day\nMy tears get in the way\nAnd I need you back to stay\n\nI wander through the night\nAnd search the world to find\nThe words to make it right\n\nAll I want is just\nThe way it used to be\nWith you here close to me\nI've got to make you see\n\nThat I'm lost without your love\nLife without you\nIsn't worth the trouble of\n\nI'm as helpless\nAs a ship without a wheel\nA touch without a feel\nI can't believe it's real\nAnd someday soon\nI'll wake\nAnd find my heart\nWon't have to break\n\nYes, I'm lost without your love\nLife without you isn't\nWorth the trouble of\n\nAll I want is just\nThe way it used to be\nI need you here with me\n\nOh, darling\nCan't you see?\nIf we had love before\nWe can have it back once more"
