    "lyrics": "Do You Wanna Make Love LyricsSometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon\nLose all their meaning with the rising moon\nHold me and tell me that the words you say are true\nAnswer the question I must ask of you .....\n\nDo you wanna make love\nOr do you just want to fool around?\nI guarantee it will bring you down\nIf you try and fool yourself\nDo you wanna make love\nOr do you just want to fool around?\nYou can take it seriously\nOr take it somewhere else\n\nTake all the freedom that a lover will allow\nIf you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now\nWhere love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep\nDon't make a promise that you cannot keep\nDo you wanna make love\nOr do you just want to fool around?\nI guarantee it will bring you down\nIf you try and fool yourself\nDo you wanna make love\nOr do you just want to fool around?\nYou can take it seriously\nOr take it somewhere else\n\nIf you wanna get close to me\nYou could do it so easily\nIs it love that I see when I look in your eyes\nOr just another empty lie?\n\nDo you wanna make love\nOr do you just want to fool around?\nI guarantee it will bring you down\nIf you try and fool yourself\nWell, do you wanna make love\nOr do you just want to fool around?\nYou can take it seriously\nOr take it somewhere elseEmbed"
