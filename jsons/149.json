    "lyrics": "Here, in this enchanted place\nHere, enclosed in your embrace\nHere with you so near to me\nHere is where I want to be\nThe world outside may be thrilled by\nThe treasures that people buy for gold\nBut I would rather be thrilled by\nThe treasures that I alone can hold\nHere, beside the warmth of you\nHere, within a dream for two\nHere, for all eternity\nHere is where I want to be\n[Foreign Content] 2.01\nHere, beside the warmth of you\nHere, within a dream for two\nHere, for all eternity\nHere is where I want to be"
