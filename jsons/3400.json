(Yeah)\nYou know (Make that change)\nI've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)\nYou got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone\nYou got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)\nHoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! (Yeah, make that change)\nMake that change, Shamone (Man in the mirror)\nYou know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)\nMake that change"
