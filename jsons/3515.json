Gigolo\nHuh, sukka?\nGigolo\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWho's looking good today?\nWho's looking good in every way?\nNo style rookie\nYou better watch don't mess with me\n\n[Chorus]\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of\nWe always hang in a Buffalo Stance\nWe do the dive every time we dance\nI'll give you love baby not romance\nI'll make a move nothing left to chance\nSo don't you get fresh with me\n\n[Interlude]\nGet funky\nYeah Timmy\nTell it like it is!\nCheck out this DJ\n[Verse 2]\nSo you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny\nWhen your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy\nBut you had to have style get a gold tooth smile\nPut a girl on the corner so you can make a pile\nCommitted a crime and went inside\nIt was coming your way but you had to survive\nWhen you lost your babe, you lost the race\nNow you're looking at me to take her place\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWho's looking good today?\nWho's looking good in ever way?\nNo style rookie\nYou better watch don't mess with me\n\n[Chorus]\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of\nWe always hang in a Buffalo Stance\nWe do the dive every time we dance\nI'll give you love baby not romance\nI'll make a move nothing left to chance\nSo don't you get fresh with me\n\n[Bridge]\nSmokin' not cokin'\nGet funky sax\nLooking good, hang in with the Wild Bunch\nLooking good in a Buffalo Stance\nLooking good when it comes to the crunch\nLooking good's a state of mind\nState of mind don't look behind you\nState of mind or you'll be dead\nState of mind may I remind you\nBomb the Bass, rock this place!\n[Interlude]\nWhat is he like? What's he like anway?\nYo man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man\nYou know I mean?\n\n[Chorus]\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of\nWe always hang in a Buffalo Stance\nWe do the dive every time we dance\nI'll give you love baby not romance\nI'll make a move nothing left to chance\nSo don't you get fresh with me\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of\nWe always hang in a Buffalo Stance\nWe do the dive every time we dance\nI'll give you love baby not romance\nI'll make a move nothing left to chance\nSo don't you get fresh with me\n\n[Bridge]\nWind on my face, sound in my ears\nWater from my eyes, and you on my mind\nAs I sink, diving down deep\nDeeper into your soul\n\n[Outro]\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of\nNo moneyman can win my love\nNo moneyman can win my love\nNo moneyman can win my love\nNo moneyman can win my love\nNo moneymanEmbed"
