How's the weather?\nIs it stormy where you are?\nYou sound so close but it feels like you're so far\nOh, would it mean anything\n\nIf you knew\nWhat I'm left imagining\nIn my mind, my mind\nWould you go? Would you go?\n\nKiss the rain\n\nAs you fall over me\nThink of me, think of me\nThink of me, only me\n\nKiss the rain\nWhenever you need me\nKiss the rain\nWhenever I'm gone too long\n\nIf your lips\nFeel hungry and tempted\nKiss the rain\nAnd wait for the dawn\nKeep in mind\nWe're under the same sky\nAnd the nights\nAs empty for me as for you\n\nIf you feel\nYou can't wait till morning\n\nKiss the rain\nKiss the rain\nKiss the rain\nKiss the rain\n\nKiss the rain\nKiss the rain\nKiss the rain\n\nHello, can you hear me?\nCan you hear me?\nCan you hear me?"
