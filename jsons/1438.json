    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe preacher talked with me and he smiled\nSaid \"Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile\nNow for once in your life you're alone\nBut you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI've just gotta get a message to you\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through\nHold on, hold on\n\n[Verse 2]\nI told him I'm in no hurry\nBut if I broke her heart, then won't you tell her I'm sorry\nAnd for once in my life, I'm alone\nAnd I gotta let her know just in time before I go\n\n[Chorus]\nI've just gotta get a message to you\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through\nHold on, hold on\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell I laughed, but that didn't hurt\nAnd it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt\nNow I'm crying, but deep down inside\nWell I did it to him, now it's my turn to die\n[Chorus]\nI've just gotta get a message to you\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through\nHold on, hold on\n\n[Outro]\nI've just gotta get a message to her\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through\nHold on, hold on\nI've just gotta get a message to her\nHold on, hold on"
