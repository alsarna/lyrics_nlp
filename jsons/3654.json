It's it\nWhat is it? It's it\nWhat is it? It's it\nWhat is it? It's it\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nIt's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n[Bridge]\nWhat is it? It's it\nWhat is it? It's it\nWhat is it? It's it\nWhat is it?\n[Chorus]\nYou want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nIt's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n[Outro]\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it! (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nIt's it! What is it?\nIt's it!"
