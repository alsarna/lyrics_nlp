It's plain to see we're over\nAnd I hate when things are over\nWhen so much is left undone\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said \"What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?\"\nShe said, \"I think I remember that film\nAnd as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it.\"\nAnd I said \"Well, that's one thing we've got.\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou say that we've got nothing in common\nNo common ground to start from\nAnd we're falling apart\nYou'll say the world has come between us\nOur lives have come between us\nStill I know you just don't care\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said \"What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?\"\nShe said, \"I think I remember that film\nAnd as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it.\"\nAnd I said \"Well, that's one thing we've got.\"\n\n[Chorus]\nOoo, and I said \"What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?\"\nShe said, \"I think I remember that film\nAnd as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it.\"\nAnd I said \"Well, that's one thing we've got.\"\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said \"What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?\"\nShe said, \"I think I remember that film\nAnd as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it.\"\nAnd I said \"Well, that's one thing we've got.\"6Embed"
