Do you love me?\nDo you love me? Do you love me\nLike I love you, oh baby?\"\n[Bridge]\nTrue love and joy and faith\nAnd all my strength I'll give to you darling\nMy love is yours exclusively to enjoy\nAny way you want to\n\n[Verse 4]\nOne thing I want you to remember\nIf you ever leave me\nI believe I'll go insane\nDarling I'll never hear the bells again\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\n\nOh baby don't leave me, don't leave me baby\nOh oh oh oh, baby\nDon't leave me, don't leave me, babyEmbed"
