( Ha, ha, ha ha! )\nHoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee dee ( Hoop dee dee! )\nThis kind of music is like heaven to me!\nHoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! )\nIt's got me higher than a kite\n\nHand me down my soup an' fish\nI am gonna get my wish, hoop dee doin' it tonight!\n\nWhen there's a trombone playin'\nHe gets a thrill! I get a thrill, I always will! He always will!\nWhen there's a concertina . . . stretched about a mile\nI always smile ( You'll see him smile! ) 'cause that's my style! ( 'Cause that's his style! )\n\nWhen there's a fiddle in the middle\nOh! it really is a riddle, how he plays a tune so sweet!\nPlays a tune so sweet that we could die!\nOh yes! . . . lead me to the floor an' hear me yell for more\n'cause I'm a hoop dee doin' kind of guy!\n\nInstrumental break\n\nHoop dee doo, hoop dee doo\nIt's got us higher than a kite\nWe're in clover, we're in bloom\nWhen we're dancin' give us room\nHoop dee doin' it with all of our might\nRain may fall an' snow may come\nNothin's gonna stop us from\nHoop dee doin' it, hoop dee doin' it\nHoop dee doin' it . . . tonight!\nMusic by Milton de Lugg"
