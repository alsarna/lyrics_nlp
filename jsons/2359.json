    "lyrics": "She came on like the night, and she held on tight\nAnd the world was right when she made love to me\nWe were free\nShe moved in like a friend\nStarted loving me\nAnd I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms\nBut the morning when I woke up\nI was here and she was gone\nNow I'm hanging on\nMaybe you can tell me\n\n[Chorus]\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong?\nOh, my darling\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong?\n\nWhere did she go\nWhen I need her close to me?\nAnd the perfect story ended at the start\nI thought you came forever\nAnd you came to break my heart\nNow I'm hanging on\nOn the chance that you'll come back to me\nOh, my love\n[Chorus]\nHow a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?\nOh, my darling\nHow a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?\nOh, my darling\n\n[Bridge]\nI could take it in my stride\nStart living for the moment\nMaybe half the things we sought were never there\nSimply open up our eyes\nAnd break it down to size\nIt isn't really fair\n\n[Chorus]\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong?\nOh, my darling\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong?"
