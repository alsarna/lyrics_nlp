(yeah)\nWhen every night you hear the sound\nOf wakin' up and breakin' down\nYou find a chance and heave it all away\nC'mon babe\nTake me in your arms--roll me through the night\nTake me to your heart--rock me tonite\n\n([unclear]) Take me in your arms\nIt's alright (it's alright)\nTake me to your heart (c'mon take me!) rock me tonite\n\nTake me in your arms--turn me to the light\nTake me to your heart\nRock me! Rock, rock, rock and rock me\nRock, rock, rock, and roll it\n\nIt's alright\nYe-yeah\nTake(?) me to the lightEmbed"
