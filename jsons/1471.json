Aww (Can't dance your Honor)\nNinety days, thirty days for boogaloo\nThirty days to learn how to shing-a-ling\nAnd thirty more for the Afro twist\nCan't dance, what is this\nCourt's in session, everybody quiet now\nCourt's in session, here comes the judge\nHere comes the judge\n\nIs that the man?\nNo, your honor\nDoes he look like the man?\nNo, your Honor\nWell, I'm sorry you got to go now\nAh ha you can't recognize the man\nNo, your Honor\nYou got to stand guilty\nHere comes the judge\nHere comes the judge\nHere comes the judge, y'all\nHere comes the judge\n\nAh yes, here comes the judge\nThey caught him stompin' down the aisle\nYes here comes the judge\nI'd rather be lost in the jungles of Brazil\nThan to face the judge\nThis morning the way he feels\nHere comes the judge\nHere comes the judge now\nDon't nobody budge\n'Cause here comes the judge\nEverybody doin' their time today"
