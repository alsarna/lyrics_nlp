    "lyrics": "The Valley Road LyricsSometimes I lead, sometimes I follow\nThis time I'll go where she wants me to go\nShe said maybe today, maybe tomorrow\nDeep in the woods down the low valley road\n\nWhile no one was lookin' on the old plantation\nHe took her all the way down the long valley road\nThey sent her away not too much later\nAnd left him walking down the old valley road\nWalk on\nWalk on, walk on alone\nWalk on, walk on\nWalk on alone, alone\n\nOut in the hall, they were talking in a whisper\nEverybody noticed she was gone awhile\nSomebody said she's gone to her sister's\nEverybody knew what they were talking about\nWhoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation\nHe showed her what they do down the long valley road\nShe came back around like nothing really happened\nAnd left him standing on the old valley road\nWalk on\nWalk on, walk on alone\nWalk on, walk on\nWalk on, walk on, on the valley road\n\nStanding like a stone on the old plantation\nThe rich old man would have never let him in\nGood enough to hire, not good enough to marry\nWhen it all happens, nobody wins\nWalk on\nWalk on, walk on alone\nWalk on, walk on\nWalk on, walk on alone, aloneEmbed"
