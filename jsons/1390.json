LyricsI wanna tell you all the story 'bout\nA Harper Valley widowed  wife\nWho had a teenage daughter\nWho attended Harper Valley Junior High\nWell her daughter came home one afternoon\nAnd didn't even stop to play\nAnd she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA\n\nWell the note said Mrs. Johnson\nYou're wearin' your dresses way too high\nIt's reported you've been drinking\nAnd a-running round with men and goin' wild\nAnd we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up\nYour little girl this way\nAnd it was signed by the Secretary\nHarper Valley PTA\nWell, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet\nThat very afternoon\nAnd they were sure surprised\nWhen Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room\nAnd as she walked up to the blackboard\nI can still recall the words she had to say\nShe said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA\n\nWell there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there\nAnd seven times he asked me for a date\nAnd Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice\nWhenever he's away\nAnd Mr. Baker can you tell us why\nYour secretary had to leave this town?\nAnd shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep\nHer window shades all pulled completely down\n\nWell, Mr Harper couldn't be here\n'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again\nAnd if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath\nYou'll find she's had a little nip of gin\nAnd then you have the nerve to tell me\nYou think that as a mother I'm not fit\nWell this is just a little Peyton Place\nAnd you're all Harper Valley hypocrites\nNo, I wouldn't put you on because it really did\nIt happened just this way\nThe day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA\nThe day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA3Embed"
