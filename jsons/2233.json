    "lyrics": "Good morning yesterday\nYou wake up and time has slipped away\nAnd suddenly it's hard to find\nThe memories you left behind\nRemember\nDo you remember\n\nThe laughter and the tears\nThe shadows of misty yesteryears\nThe good times and the bad you've seen\nAnd all the others in between\nRemember\nDo you remember the times of your life (do you remember)\n\nReach back for the joy and the sorrow\nPut them away in your mind\nFor memories are time that you borrow\nTo spend when you get to tomorrow\n\nHere comes the setting sun\nThe seasons are passing one by one\nSo gather moments while you may\nCollect the dreams you dream today\nRemember\nWill you remember the times of your life\nGather moments while you may\nCollect the dreams you dream today\nRemember\nWill you remember the times of your life\nOf your life\nOf your life\n\nDo you remember, baby\nDo you remember the times of your life\nDo you remember, baby\nDo you remember the times of your life"
