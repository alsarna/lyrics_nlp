    "lyrics": "We can never know about the days to come\nBut we think about them anyway\nAnd I wonder if I'm really with you now\nOr just chasing after some finer day\n\nAnticipation\nAnticipation\nIs making me wait\nIs keeping me waiting\n\nAnd I tell you how easy it is to be with you\nAnd how right your arms feel around me\nBut I rehearsed those words just late last night\nWhen I was thinking about how right tonight might be\n\nAnticipation\nAnticipation\nIs making me wait\nIs keeping me waiting\n\nAnd tomorrow we might not be together\nI'm no prophet\nI don't know nature's way\nSo I'll try to see into your eyes right now\nAnd stay right here\nCause these are the good old days"
