    "lyrics": "Got To Give It Up Part 1 LyricsI used to go out to parties, and stand around\n'Cause I was too nervous, to really get down\nBut my body yearned to be free\nI got up on the floor, somebody could choose me\n\nNo more standin' there beside the walls\nFinally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball\nLong as you're groovin', there's always a chance\nSomebody watchin' might wanna make romance\n\nMove your body, ooh baby, you dance all night\nTo the groove and feel alright\nEverybody's groovin' on like a fool\nBut if you see me, spread out and let me in\nBaby, just party high and low\nLet me step into your erotic zone\nMove it up, turn it 'round\nOoo, shake it down\nOww, you can love me when you want to, babe\nThis is such a groovy party, baby\nWe're here face to face, everybody's swingin'\n\nThis is such a groovy place\nAll the young ladies are so fine\nYou're movin' your body easy with no doubts\nI know what you thinkin', baby, you want to turn me out\nI think I'm gonna let you do it, babe\n\nKeep on dancin'\nGot to give it up\n\nKeep on dancin'\nGot to give it up\n\nKeep on dancin'\nGot to give it up\n\nKeep on dancin'\nGot to give it up\n\nKeep on dancin'\nGot to give it up...Embed"
