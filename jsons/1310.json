    "lyrics": "Please release me, let me go\nFor I don't love you anymore\nTo waste our lives would be a sin\nRelease me and let me love again\n\nI have found a new love, dear\nAnd I will always want her near\nHer lips are warm while yours are cold\nRelease me, my darling, let me go\n\n(Please release me, let me go)\nFor I don't love you anymore\n(To waste my life would be a sin)\nSo release me and let me love again\n\nPlease release me, can't you see\nYou'd be a fool to cling to me\nTo live our lives would bring us pain\nSo release me and let me love again\n(Let me love, let me love)"
