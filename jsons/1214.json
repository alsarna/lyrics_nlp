    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen I said I needed you\nYou said you would always stay\nIt wasn't me who changed but you\nAnd now you've gone away\nDon't you see that now you've gone\nAnd I'm left here on my own\nThat I have to follow you\nAnd beg you to come home?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't have to say you love me\nJust be close at hand\nYou don't have to stay forever\nI will understand\nBelieve me, believe me\nI can't help but love you\nBut believe me\nI'll never tie you down\n\n[Verse 2]\nLeft alone with just a memory\nLife seems dead and so unreal\nAll that's left is loneliness\nThere's nothing left to feel\n[Chorus]\nYou don't have to say you love me\nJust be close at hand\nYou don't have to stay forever\nI will understand\nBelieve me, believe me\nYou don't have to say you love me\nJust be close at hand\nYou don't have to stay forever\nI will understand\n\n[Outro]\nBelieve me, believe me, believe me"
