    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMusic is a world within itself\nWith a language we all understand\nWith an equal opportunity\nFor all to sing, dance and clap their hands\nBut just because a record has a groove\nDon't make it in the groove\nBut you can tell right away at letter A\nWhen the people start to move\n\n[Chorus]\nThey can feel it all over\nThey can feel it all over people\nThey can feel it all over\nThey can feel it all over people\n\n[Verse 2]\nMusic knows it is and always will\nBe one of the things that life just won't quit\nBut here are some of music's pioneers\nThat time will not allow us to forget\nFor there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo\nAnd the king of all Sir Duke\nAnd with a voice like Ella's ringing out\nThere's no way the band can lose\n[Chorus]\nYou can feel it all over\nYou can feel it all over people\nYou can feel it all over\nYou can feel it all over people\nYou can feel it all over\nYou can feel it all over people\nYou can feel it all over\nYou can feel it all over people\n\n[Breakdown]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can feel it all over\nYou can feel it all over people\nYou can feel it all over\nYou can feel it all over people\nYou can feel it all over\nYou can feel it all over people\nYou can feel it all over\nI can feel it all, all, all-all-all over people\n\n[Outro]\nCan't you feel it all over?\nCome on, let's feel it all over people\nYou can feel it all over\nEverybody, all over people"
