    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful\nA miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical\nAnd all the birds in the trees, well, they'd be singing so happily\nOh, joyfully, oh, playfully watching me\nBut then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible\nLogical, oh, responsible, practical\nAnd then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable\nOh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThere are times when all the world's asleep\nThe questions run too deep\nFor such a simple man\nWon't you please, please tell me what we've learned?\nI know it sounds absurd\nPlease tell me who I am\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said, watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical\nA liberal, oh, fanatical, criminal\nOh, won't you sign up your name? We'd like to feel you're acceptable\nRespectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable\nOh, take, take, take it, yeah\n\n[Instrumental bridge]\n[Chorus 2]\nBut at night, when all the world's asleep\nThe questions run so deep\nFor such a simple man\nWon't you please (Won't you tell me)\nPlease tell me what we've learned?\n(Can you hear me?) I know it sounds absurd\n(Won't you help me?) But please, tell me who I am\nWho I am\nWho I am\nWho I am\nYeah!\nOh!\nOoo!\nHey!\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause I was feeling so illogical\nD-d-d-d-d-d-digital\nYeah, one, two, three, five\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOoh, it's getting unbelievable\nYeah\nB-b-bloody marvelous"
