    "lyrics": "I used to think that love was just a fairy tale\nUntil that first hello, until that first smile\nBut if i had to do it all again\nI wouldn't change a thing\nCause this love is everlasting\n\nSuddenly, life has new meaning to me\nThere's beauty up above\nAnd things we never take notice of\nYou wake up, and suddenly you're in love\n\nOoh yeah\n\nGirl you're everything a man could want and more\nOne thousand words are not enough\nTo say what I feel inside\nHolding hands as we walk along the shore\nNever felt like this before\nNow you're all I'm living for\n\nSuddenly, life has new meaning to me\nThere's beauty up above\nAnd things we never take notice of\nYou wake up, and suddenly you're in love\n\nEach day I pray, this love affair would last forever\nOh hoh\nSuddenly, Life has new meaning to me\nThere's beauty up above\nAnd things we never take notice of\nYou wake up, suddenly you're in love\nOoh\nThere's beauty up above\nAnd things we never take notice of\nYou wake up, suddenly you're in love\nOoh..."
