    "lyrics": "Things went wrong today\nBad news came my way\nI woke up to find\nThat I had blew my mind\n\nWestern Union man\nBad news in his hand\nKnocking at my door\nSelling me the score\n\nFifteen cents a word to read\nA telegram I didn't need\nSays she doesn't care no more\nThink I'll throw it on the floor\n\nGot your cable just today\nKilled my groove I've got to say\nWestern Union\nDit, da dit, da dit (8x)\n\nNow you've gone away, and\nHow it's sad to say you've gone\nI remember what they said\nNow I'm going out of my head\nTelegram just had to say\nYou've learned your lesson all the way..ay\n(BREAK)\n\nTelegram just had to say\nYou've learned your lesson all the way..ay\nWestern Union\nDit, da dit, da dit (8x)\n\nI'll be on my way 'cause\nThere's another girl for me\nI'll be sure of her, and\nThings will be as they were\nWestern Union\nOh, Western Union\nWestern Union\nWestern Union (fade)"
