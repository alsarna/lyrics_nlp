He's been workin' so hard\n(Yeah!) I've been workin' too, baby\n(Yeah!) Every night and day\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)\n\nWe gotta get out of this place\nIf it's the last thing we ever do\nWe gotta get out of this place\n'Cause, girl, there's a better life for me and you\n\nNow, my girl, you're so young and pretty\nAnd one thing I know is true, yeah\nYou'll be dead before your time is due, I know it\nWatch my daddy in bed a-dyin'\nWatched his hair been turnin' grey, yeah\nHe's been workin' and slavin' his life away\nI know he's been workin' so hard\n\n(Yeah!)
