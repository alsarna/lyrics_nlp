    "lyrics": "I Believe LyricsI believe for every drop of rain that falls\nA flower grows\nI believe that somewhere in the darkest night\nA candle glows\nI believe for everyone who goes astray\nSome one will come to show the way\nI believe, I believe\n\nI believe above the storm the smallest prayer\nWill still be heard\nI believe that someone in the great somewhere\nHears every word\nEvery time I hear a new born baby cry\nOr touch a leaf or see the sky\nI believe, I believe\nI believe the lord in heaven he is my guide\nMy sins he'll hide\nI believe on calvary that jesus died\nThat pierced side\nI believe in death we'll part to rise again\nAnd meet in heaven to that loud amen\nThen I know why, I believeEmbed"
