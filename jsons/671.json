    "lyrics": "In every other song that I've heard lately\nSome fellow gets shot\nAnd his baby and his best friend both die with him\nAs likely as not\nIn half of the other songs\nSome Cat's crying or ready to die\nWe've lost most of our happy people\nAnd I'm wondering why\n\nLet's think about living\nLet's think about loving\nLet's think about the whoopin'\nAnd hoppin and boppin'\nAnd the lovie, lovie dovin'\nLet's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'\nAnd the shooting and the dying\nAnd the fellow with a switchblade knife\nLet's think about living\nLet's think about life\n\nWe lost old Marty Robbins\nDown in old El Paso a little while back\nAnd now Miss Patti Page or one of them\nIs a-wearing black\nAnd Cath's Clown has Don and Phil\nWhere they feel like a-they could die\nIf we keep on a-losin' our singers like that\nI'll be the only one you can buy'\nLet's think about living\nLet's think about loving\nLet's think about the whoopin'\nAnd hoppin and boppin'\nAnd the lovie, lovie dovin'\nLet's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'\nAnd the shooting and the dying\nAnd the fellow with a switchblade knife\nLet's think about living\nLet's think about life"
