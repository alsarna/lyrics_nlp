    "lyrics": "Goodbye Jimmy Goodbye\n- Artist: Kathy Linden\n- peak Billboard position # 11 in 1959\n- Words and Music by Jack Vaughn\nCHORUS\nGoodbye, Jimmy, goodbye\nGoodbye, Jimmy, goodbye\nI'll see you again but I don't know when\nGoodbye, Jimmy, goodbye\nWind is a-blowin', rain starts to fall\nTrain is a-tootin' its long, lonesome call\nWheels are clickin' their way down the track\nCountin' the days till he's comin' back\nCHORUS\nWhen he has traveled the land and the sea\nHe'll stop his wand'rin' and come home to me\nGive me a kiss for each tear and each sigh\nTill then my Jimmy, my Jimmy, goodbye\nCHORUS\nGoodbye Jimmy goodbye"
