    "lyrics": "Thought I was in love before\nAnd then you moved in next door\nPretty blue eyes, pretty blue eyes\n\nAll the guys from the neighborhood\nKeep sayin' you sure look good\nWith your blue eyes, pretty blue eyes\n\nSaw you from my window\nMy heart skipped a beat\nGonna sit by your doorstep\nSo that I can meet\n\nPretty blue eyes, please come out today\nSo I can tell you what I have to say\nThat I love you, love you\nPretty blue eyes\n\nSaw you from my window\nMy heart skipped a beat\nGonna sit by your doorstep\nSo that I can meet\n\nPretty blue eyes, please come out today\nSo I can tell you what I have to say\nThat I love you, love you\nPretty blue eyes\n[Repeat to Fade]\nPretty blue eyes"
