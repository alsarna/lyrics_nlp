How often does this happen?\"\nHe said, \"Everyday about this time.\"\nI said, \"Well, why do you just sit out here then?\"\nHe said \"Cause I cannot believe that this happened.\"\n\n(pre-chorus)\nI said, \"Reach out, take my hand, you'll understand.\"\n\n(chorus)\nBaby, everything is alright\nUptight, outta sight\nBaby, everything is alright\nUptight, outta sight\n\n(verse 2)\nLittle ole' man was sittin' on the step, same ole' man\nAnd a tear trickled down his cheek\nI said, \"What's the matter?\"\nHe said, \"A herd of elephants just stampeded over me.\"\nI said, \"Hmm\" same \"Hmm.\"\nI said, \"How often does this happen?\"\nHe said, \"Everyday, a half hour after the train runs over me.\"\n(pre-chorus)\nI said, \"Reach out, take my hand, you'll understand.\"\n\n(chorus)\nBaby, everything is alright\nUptight, outta sight\nBaby, everything is alright\nUptight, outta sight\n\n(verse 3)\nLittle ole' man sittin' on a step, same ole' man\nA tear trickled down his cheek\nI said, \"Hey, how ya doin' after that train ran over ya?\"\nHe said, \"WHAT train?\"\nI said, \"The train that ran over ya a half hour before the elephants stampeded over ya.\"\nHe said, \"What elephants?\"\nI said, \"Hmm\" same \"Hmm.\"\nHe says, \"You're a young boy.\"\nSays, \"Ya got a lot to learn.\"\n\n(pre-chorus)\nHe says \"Reach out, take my hand, you'll understand.\"\n\n(chorus)\nBaby, everything is alright\nUptight, outta sight\nBaby, everything is alright\nUptight, outta sight"
