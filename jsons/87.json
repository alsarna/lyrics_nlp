    "lyrics": "Tell me why, though I try to forget\nTell me why, why I think of you yet\nI know I'll never be free\nWhat has happened to me?\n\nTell me why, when we danced until three\nTell me why, why my heart couldn't see\nI never dreamed of romance\nNever gave it a chance\n\nWhen I think of how you looked that day\nIn your gown of silk and lace\nShould have known the day you came my way\nThat this was the time and the place\n\nTell me why I keep fooling my heart\nWhen I know it was love from the start\nWhy don't we give it a try?\nIf you know, tell me why\n\nTell me why I keep fooling my heart\nWhen I know it was love from the start\nWhy don't we give it a try?\nIf you know, tell me why\n\nTell me\nTell me why"
