    "lyrics": "The love light's gone from your eyes\nYou're telling me little white lies\nIt seems you're not at home\nEach time I call\n(Each time you call)\nI guess that I'd be a fool\nNot to know your heart's grown cruel\nI see the writing on\nThe wall (on the wall)\nIt's not too hard to\nRead between the lines, dear\nSo plain to see love\nDidn't conquer all\nIts not too hard\nTo recognize the signs, dear\nI see the writing on the wall\n(Writing on the wall)\nFriends say, this won't be the end\nYou'll want my love again\nBut my heart knows\nBetter than them all\n(Better than them all)\nThis time I feel it's goodbye\nExcuse me if I cry\nBut I see the writing\nOn the wall (on the wall)\nIt's not too hard to\nRead between the lines, dear\nIt's plain to see love\nDidn't conquer all\nIt's not too hard\nTo recognize the signs, dear\nI see the writing on the wall\nI see the writing on the wall"
