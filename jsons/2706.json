    "lyrics": "Overnight scenes, dinner and wine\nSaturday girls\nI was never in love, never had the time\nIn my hustle and hurry world\nLaughing myself to sleep\nWaking up lonely\nI needed someone to hold me oh oh oh\n\nIt's such a crazy old town\nIt can drag you down\nTill you run out of dreams\nSo you party all night to the music and lights\nBut you don't know what happiness means\nI was dancing in the dark with strangers\nNo love around me\nWhen suddenly you found me oh oh oh\n\nGirl you're every woman in the world to me\nYou're my fantasy, you're my reality\nGirl you're every woman in the world to me\nYou're everything I need, you're everything to me\nOh girl\n\nEverything good, everything fine\nThat's what you are\nSo put your hand in mine\nAnd together we'll climb\nAs high as the highest star\nI'm living a lifetime in every minute\nThat we're together\nAnd I'll stay right here forever oh oh oh\nChorus"
