(Ayy, yay)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\nHow I feel about you (No, no)\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\nHow I feel about you\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'll love you more in the rain or shine\nAnd making love in the rain is fine\nA love so good and I call it mine\nLove is blind\n[Chorus]\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\nHow I feel about you (No, no, no)\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\nHow I feel about you (Ho-oh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBelieve me when I say that I do care (I can tell you, woo)\nI'd like to run my fingers through your hair (I can tell you how)\nBaby, if you left I could not bear (I can tell you how)\nPlease don't share\nDo you love me? Please let me know (I can tell you)\nDon't fight the feeling, just let it show (I can tell you)\nA feeling so deep that comes within (I can tell you)\nWhat kind of love am I in? Ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\nHow I feel about you (No, no, no)\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\nHow I feel about you (Ho-oh)\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you and I were one, girl\nThe love we'd share would be so fun\nJust take my hand and you'll see, girl\nThat we'd take off into another world\n[Chorus]\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day (Uh-huh)\n(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\n(Making love in the rain is fine, uh-huh)\n(Kyle West, break it down, ooh)\n\n[Outro]\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\n(Night and day, night and day, night and day)\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\n(Making love in the rain is fine, uh-huh, woo)\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\n(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, hoo, hoo)\nI can tell you how I feel about you night and day\n(How I feel about you, how I feel about you)2Embed"
