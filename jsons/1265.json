Things are okay\nWell, I know that they're not\nAnd I still may have lost you\n\nWoman, do you love me?\nWoman, if you need me then\nBelieve me I need you\nTo be my woman\n\nI hope you'll take your time and tell me\nWhen we're alone, love will come home\nI would give up my world\nIf you'll say that my girl is my woman\n\nI've got plenty of time\nTime just to get through it\nOnce again you'll be mine\nI still think we can do it\nAnd you know how much I love you\nWoman, don't forsake me\nWoman, if you take me then\nBelieve me I'll take you\nTo be my woman"
