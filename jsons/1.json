Are you real, Mona Lisa?\nOr just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?\nOr is this your way to hide a broken heart?\nMany dreams have been brought to your doorstep\nThey just lie there, and they die there\nAre you warm? Are you real, Mona Lisa?\nOr just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?\n[Outro]\nMona Lisa\nMona Lisa1Embed"
