    "lyrics": "Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you\nYou're so like the lady with the mystic smile\nIs it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?\nFor that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?\n\nDo you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?\nOr is this your way to hide a broken heart?\nMany dreams have been brought to your doorstep\nThey just lie there and they die there\n\nAre you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?\nOr just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?\n\nDo you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?\nOr is this your way to hide a broken heart?\nMany dreams have been brought to your doorstep\nThey just lie there and they die there\n\nAre you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?\nOr just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?\n\nMona Lisa, Mona Lisa"
