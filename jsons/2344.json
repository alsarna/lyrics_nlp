    "lyrics": "Weekend in New England LyricsLast night I waved goodbye\nNow it seems years\nI'm back in the city where nothing is clear\nBut thoughts of me holding you\nBringing us near\n\nAnd tell me\nWhen will our eyes meet?\nWhen can I touch you?\nWhen will this strong yearning end?\nAnd when will I hold you again?\n\nTime in New England took me away\nTo long rocky beaches\nAnd you by the bay\nWe started a story whose end must now wait\nAnd tell me\nWhen will our eyes meet?\nWhen can I touch you?\nWhen will this strong yearning end?\nAnd when will I hold you again?\n\nI feel the change coming\nI feel the wind blow\nI feel brave and daring\nI feel my blood flow\nWith you\nI could bring out all the love that I had\nWith you\nThere's a heaven so earth ain't so bad\n\nAnd tell me\nWhen will our eyes meet?\nWhen can I touch you?\nWhen will this strong yearning end?\nAnd when will I hold you again?\nAgainEmbed"
