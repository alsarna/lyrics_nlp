    "lyrics": "Born free, as free as the wind blows\nAs free as the grass grows\nBorn free to follow your heart\n\nLive free and beauty surrounds you\nThe world still astounds you\nEach time you look at a star\n\nStay free, where no walls divide you\nYou're free as the roaring tide\nSo there's no need to hide\n\nBorn free and life is worth living\nBut only worth living\n'Cause you're born free\n\nBorn free\nBorn free\nBorn free"
