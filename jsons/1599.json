    "lyrics": "I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day\nWhen I thought I'd lay myself down to rest\nIn a big field of tall grass\nI laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face\nAs I fell asleep and dreamed\nI dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie\nAnd that I was the star of the movie\nThis really blew my mind\nThe fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome\nShould be the star of a Hollywood movie\nBut there I was\nI was taken to a place\nThe hall of the mountain kings\nI stood high by the mountain tops\nNaked to the world\nIn front of\nEvery kind of girl\nThere was long ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones\nBlack ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones\nOut of the middle, came a lady\nShe whispered in my ear\nSomething crazy\nShe said...\n\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\n\nI could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back\nAs she disappeared, but soon she returned\nIn her hand was a bottle of wine\nIn the other a glass\nShe poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass\nAnd raised it to her lips\nAnd just before she drank it, she said\n\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\nSpill the wine, take that pearl\n\nIt's on girl, all you gotta do is spill that wine\nSpill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah! yeah!\nSpill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine\nSpill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine\nTake that pearl!"
