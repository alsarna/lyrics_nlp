It’s like I’m seventeen again\nPeach fuzz on my face\nLookin’, on the case\nTryna find a hella taste\nOh My God, I’m on the chase\nChevy, its gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it\nDippin’ away, time keep slippin’ away\nZip in the safe, flippin’ for pay\nTippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint\nUp front four blunts, like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”\nSo what we get drunk\nSo what we smoke weed\nWe’re just having fun\nWe don’t care who sees\nSo what we go out\nThat’s how it's supposed to be\nLiving young and wild and free\nUh, and now I don't even care\n'Cause me and my team in here\nThere's gon' be some weed in the air\nTell 'em Mac\nBlowin' everywhere we goin'\nAnd now ya knowin'\nWhen I step right up\nGet my lighter so I can light up\nThat's how it should be done\nSoon as you thinkin' you're down\nFind how to turn things around\nNow things are looking up\nFrom the ground up\nPound up\nIt's Taylor Gang\nSo turn my sound up\nAnd mount up\nAnd do my thang\nNow I'm chillin'\nFresh outta class feelin'\nLike I'm on my own\nAnd I could probably own a building\nGot my own car\nNo job, no children\nHad this science project\nMe and Mac killed it\nT-H-C\nM-A-C\nD-E-V\nH-D-3\nHigh as me\nThis is us\nWe gon' fuss\nAnd we gon' fight\nAnd we gon' roll\nAnd live our life\nSo what we get drunk\nSo what we smoke weed\nWe’re just having fun\nWe don’t care who sees\nSo what we go out\nThat’s how it's supposed to be\nLiving young and wild and free\nYea, roll one, smoke one\nWhen you live like this you’re supposed to party\nRoll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun\nSo we just, roll one, smoke one\nWhen you live like this you’re supposed to party\nRoll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun\nSo what we get drunk\nSo what we smoke weed\nWe’re just having fun\nWe don’t care who sees\nSo what we go out\nThat’s how it's supposed to be\nLiving young and wild and free"
