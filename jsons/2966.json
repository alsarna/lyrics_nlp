    "lyrics": "I can't keep up with what's been going down\nI think my heart must just be slowing down\nAmong the human beings\nIn their designer jeans\nAm I the only one who hears the screams\nAnd the strangled cries of lawyers in love\n\nGod sends his spaceships to America the beautiful\nThey land at six o'clock and there we are, the dutiful\nEating from TV trays\nTuned into Happy Days\nWaiting for World War III while Jesus slaves\nTo the mating calls of lawyers in love\n\nLast night I watched the news from Washington, the capital\nThe Russians escaped while we weren't watching them, like Russians will\nNow we've got all this room\nWe've even got the moon\nAnd I hear the USSR will be open soon\nAs vacation land for lawyers in love\n\nLawyers in love\nLawyers in love"
