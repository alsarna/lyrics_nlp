    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nAs I sit looking out the window\nI can still remember\nThey call me to tell me\nYou went away\nIt was such a cold day\n\n[Hook:]\nOn a Sunday morning\nIt came without a warning\nAnd all the pain I felt inside\nI just can't forget you\n\nI'm feeling so alone\nThough many times I've tried\nI can't get you off my mind\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm thinking of you\nWonder where you are tonight\nI wish that I could hold you tight\nI'm thinking of you\nWish you could stay\nBut you're so far away\nSo far away\n[Verse 2:]\nAnd even though you're gone\nI know you're happy where you are\nI know someday\nWe'll be together together again\n\n[Repeat Hook:]\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Bridge:]\nI know someday I'll hold you again\nYou and me together again\nBut until that day\nI'm thinking of you\n\n[Repeat Chorus x2:]"
