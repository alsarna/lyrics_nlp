Was it something you said?\nDon't leave me hangin' in a city so dead\nHeld up so high on such a breakable thread (Breakable thread)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou were all the things I thought I knew\nAnd I thought we could be\n\n[Chorus]\nYou were everything, everything that I wanted (That I wanted)\nWe were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (We lost it)\nAnd all of our memories so close to me just fade away\nAll this time, you were pretending\nSo much for my happy ending\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh) So much for my happy ending\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nOh-oh, oh-oh\n[Verse 2]\nYou've got your dumb friends\nI know what they say (I know what they say)\nThey tell you I'm difficult, but so are they (But so are they)\nBut they don't know me\nDo they even know you? (Even know you)\nAll the things you hide from me\nAll the shit that you do (All the shit that you do)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou were all the things I thought I knew\nAnd I thought we could be\n\n[Chorus]\nYou were everything, everything that I wanted (That I wanted)\nWe were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (We lost it)\nAnd all of our memories so close to me just fade away\nAll this time, you were pretending\nSo much for my happy ending\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's nice to know that you were there\nThanks for acting like you care\nAnd making me feel like I was the only one\nIt's nice to know we had it all\nThanks for watching as I fall\nAnd letting me know we were done\n[Chorus]\nHe was everything, everything that I wanted\nWe were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it\nAnd all of our memories so close to me just fade away\nAll this time, you were pretending\nSo much for my happy ending\n\n[Chorus]\nYou were everything, everything that I wanted (That I wanted)\nWe were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (We lost it)\nAnd all of our memories so close to me just fade away\nAll this time, you were pretending\nSo much for my happy ending\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh) So much for my happy ending\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh) So much for my happy ending\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
