    "lyrics": "I'm an ever rollin' wheel, without a destination real\nI'm an ever spinning top, whirling around till i drop\nOh but what am i to do, my mind is in a whirlpool\nGive me a little hope, one small thing to cling to\n\nYou got me going in circles(oh round and round i go)\nYou got me going in circles\n(oh round and round i go, i'm spun out over you)\n\nI'm a faceless clock, with timeless hopes that never stop\nLord but i feel that way, of my soul. My soul is stay\nOh but what am i to do, my mind is in a whirlpool\nGive me a little hope, one small thing to cling to\n\nYou got me going in circles(oh round and round i go)\nYou got me going in circles\n(oh round and round i go) I'm spun out over you\n(i need you baby) over you (i need you baby) spun out over you\n(i need you baby, i need you baby baby) (oh baby)\nI'm spun(i need you baby) i said i'm spun out over you(i need you baby)\nSpun out over you(i need you baby, i need you baby, i need you baby)"
