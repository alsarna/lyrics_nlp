I've got to go\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll that matters is\nThat you treat me right\nGive me all the things I need\nThat money can't buy, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nThink you gotta keep me iced, you don't\nThink I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (Baby)\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)\nThink I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (No)\nIf I wanna floss, I got my own\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\n\n[Bridge]\nLove don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYou think the money that you make (That you make)\nCan substitute the time you take (The time you take)\nTo get the keys into my heart\nThink you can win my heart, don't know what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)\nI think you need to take some time\nTo show me that your love is true (Ooh)\nThere's more than dollar signs in you\nThen you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart\n[Chorus]\nThink you gotta keep me iced, you don't\nThink I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)\nThink I wanna drive your Benz, I don't\nIf I wanna floss, I got my own\nEven if you were broke (Even if you were broke)\nMy love don't cost a thing (My love don't cost a thing)\nThink you gotta keep me iced, you don't\nThink I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\nThink I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)\nIf I wanna floss, I got my own (If I wanna, don't)\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\nThink you gotta keep me iced, you don't (Think I wanna)\nThink I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (If I want my own)\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\nThink I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)\nIf I wanna floss, I got my own (If I want my own)\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing12Embed"
