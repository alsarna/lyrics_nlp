    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI kept the right ones out\nAnd let the wrong ones in\nHad an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins\nThere were times in my life\nWhen I was goin' insane\nTryin' to walk through the pain\nWhen I lost my grip, and I hit the floor\nYeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door\nI was so sick and tired of livin' a lie\nI was wishin that I would die\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's amazing\nWith the blink of an eye you finally see the light\nIt's amazing\nWhen the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright\nIt's amazing\nAnd I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nThat one last shot's a permanent vacation\nAnd how high can you fly with broken wings?\nLife's a journey, not a destination\nAnd I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings\n[Verse 2]\nYou have to learn to crawl\nBefore you learn to walk\nBut I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah\nI was out on the street\nJust tryin' to survive\nScratchin' to stay alive\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's amazing\nWith the blink of an eye you finally see the light\nIt's amazing\nWhen the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright\nIt's amazing\nAnd I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight\n\nDesperate hearts, desperate hearts....\n\n[Solo]\n\n[Outro: Spoken]\n\"So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night.\""
