    "lyrics": "Once I was alone\nSo lonely and then\nYou came, out of nowhere\nLike the sun up from the hills\n\nCold, cold was the wind\nWarm, warm were your lips\nOut there, on that ski trail\nWhere your kiss filled me with thrills\n\nA weekend in Canada, a change of scene\nWas the most I bargained for\nAnd then I discovered you and in your eyes\nI found the love that I couldn't ignore\n\nDown, down came the sun\nFast, fast, fast, beat my heart\nI knew when the sun set\nFrom that day, we'd never ever part"
