    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe was staring out the window, of that SUV\nComplaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18\nShe said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules\nMama put the car in park out there in front of the school\nAnd she kissed her head and said, I was just like you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're gonna miss this\nYou're gonna want this back\nYou're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast\nThese are some good times\nSo take a good look around\nYou may not know it now\nBut you're gonna miss this\n\n[Verse 2]\nBefore she knows it she's a brand new bride\nIn her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by\nHe tells her, it's a nice place\nShe says, it'll do for now\nStarts talking about babies, and buying a house\nDaddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you're gonna miss this\nYou're gonna want this back\nYou're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast\nThese are some good times\nSo take a good look around\nYou may not know it now\nBut you're gonna miss this\n[Verse 3]\nFive years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater\nDog's barking, phone's ringing\nOne kid's crying, one kid's screaming\nShe keeps apologizing\nHe says, they don't bother me\nI've got two babies of my own\nOne's 36, one's 23\nHeh... It's hard to believe, but\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you're gonna miss this\nYou're gonna want this back\nYou're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast\nThese are some good times\nSo take a good look around\nYou may not know it now\nBut you're gonna miss this\nYou're gonna miss this\nYeah, you're gonna miss this"
