You're not here with me\nYou never said goodbye, someone tell me, why\nDid you have to go and leave my world so cold?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery day I sit and ask myself, \"How did love slip away?\"\nSomething whispers in my ear and says\n\n[Chorus]\nThat you are not alone, I am here with you\nThough you're far away, I am here to stay\nBut you are not alone, I am here with you\nThough we're far apart, you're always in my heart\nBut you are not alone\n[Post-Chorus]\n'Lone, 'lone\nWhy, 'lone\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust the other night, I thought I heard you cry\nAsking me to come and hold you in my arms\nI can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear\nBut first I need your hand, then forever can begin\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery day I sit and ask myself, \"How did love slip away?\"\nSomething whispers in my ear and says\n\n[Chorus]\nThat you are not alone, I am here with you\nThough you're far away, I am here to stay\nBut you are not alone, I am here with you\nThough we're far apart, you're always in my heart\nBut you are not alone\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin'\nAnd girl you know that I'll be there\nI'll be there\n[Chorus]\nThat you are not alone, I am here with you\nThough you're far away, I am here to stay\nBut you are not alone, I am here with you\nThough we're far apart, you're always in my heart\nThat you are not alone, I am here with you\n(You are not alone, I am here with you)\nThough you're far away, I am here to stay\n(Though you're far away, you and me)\nBut you are not alone, I am here with you\n(You are always in my heart)\nThough we're far apart, you're always in my heart\nFor you are not alone (Not alone, oh)\n\n[Outro]\nYou are not alone, you are not alone\nSay it again\nYou are not alone, you are not alone\nNot alone, not alone\nIf you just reach out for me, girl\nIn the morning, in the evening\nNot alone, not alone\nYou and me, not alone, oh!\nTogether, together\nNot not being alone!\nNot not being alone!\nYou believe in me!33Embed"
