    "lyrics": "Everybody's talking at me\nI don't hear a word they're saying\nOnly the echoes of my mind\n\nPeople stopping, staring\nI can't see their faces\nOnly the shadows of their eyes\n\nI'm going where the sun keeps shining\nThrough the pouring rain\nGoing where the weather suits my clothes\n\nBanking off of the northeast winds\nSailing on a summer breeze\nAnd skipping over the ocean like a stone\n\nWah, wah wah-wah wah\nWah-wah wah-wah, wah wah-wah\nWahhh\n\nI'm going where the sun keeps shining\nThrough the pouring rain\nGoing where the weather suits my clothes\n\nBanking off of the northeast winds\nSailing on a summer breeze\nAnd skipping over the ocean like a stone\nEverybody's talking at me\nCan't hear a word they're saying\nOnly the echoes of my mind\n\nI won't let you leave my love behind\nNo, I won't let you leave\nWah, wah\nI won't let you leave my love behind"
