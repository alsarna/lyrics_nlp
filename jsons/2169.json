    "lyrics": "I was travellin' down the road feelin' hungry and cold\nI saw a sign sayin' \"Food and Drinks for Everyone\"\nSo naturally, I thought I would take me a look inside\nI saw so much food there was water coming from my eyes\n\nYeah, there was ham and there was turkey, there was caviar\nAnd long tall glasses with wine up to y'are\nThen somebody grabbed me, threw me out of my chair\nSaid, \"Before you can eat, you gotta dance like Fred Astaire\"\n\nYou know I can't dance, you know I can't dance\nYou know I can't dance, you know I can't dance, I can't dance!\n\nI am a man of the road, a hobo by name\nI don't seek entertainment, just poultry and game\nBut if it's all the same to you then yes, I will try my hand\nIf you were hungry as me then I'm sure you will understand\n\nHmm, now wait a minute, of course I can dance\nOf course I can dance, I'm sure I can dance\nI'm sure I can dance, I can dance\nI can dance, I really hit the floor, ah, it feels good\nLook at me dancin'!\n\nI did a Two Step, Quick Step and a Bossanova\nA little Victor Sylvester and a Rudy Valentino\nYou should have seen me moving right across the floor\nHand me down my tuxedo, next week I'm coming back for more\nI can dance, oh yes, I can dance\nLook at me dance on the floor movin'\nI feel good, I can dance, I can dance\nI can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can dance\n\nSongwriters:  Leo Sayer and David Courtney"
