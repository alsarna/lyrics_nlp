    "lyrics": "I love the little wiggle in your walk\nThe way you cuddle on my shoulder\nBut you're too young to know this, girl\nSo come back when you're older\n\nCause you're too sweet and innocent\nBut you're just\nOh, too young for me\n\nThe way you hold me not too tight\nThe tender way you kiss good night\nStill say you've got some growing up to do\n\nWhoa, oh, ho\nYoung and beautiful is a love\nOh, you give to me, yeah\nYou're not hip\nSo get with it, girl\nGo on home to your make-believe world\n\nSweet and innocent\nYou're too young and beautiful for me\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\n\nSweet and innocent\nBut you're just\nOh, too young for me, yeah\nI'd like to kiss you and hold you tight\nSo go on home, girl\nOr I just might\nYou're too sweet and innocent\nYou're too young and beautiful for me\n\nYou're so sweet and innocent\nBut you're much too young, little girl\nGo on home\nJust leave me alone, little girl"
