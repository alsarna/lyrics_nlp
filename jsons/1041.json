    "lyrics": "See the funny little clown\nSee him laughing as you walk by\nEverybody thinks he's happy\n'Cause you never see a tear in his eye\n\nNo one knows he's crying\nNo one knows he's dying on the inside\n'Cause he's laughing on the outside, mm\nNo one knows, no one knows\n\nSee the funny little clown\nHe's hiding behind a smile\nThey all think he's laughing\nBut I know he's really crying all the while\n\nHow his heart is aching\nHow his heart is breaking on the inside\nBut he keeps laughing on the outside, mm\nNo one knows, no one knows\n\nThis funny little clown\nYou never used to see him around\nWithout his girl beside him\nTo love and guide him\n\nUntil one day his girl just walked away\nAnd to this very day he says\n\"He never loved her anyway\"\nMm, and no one knows except for me\nBecause you see I'm that funny little clown"
