(Oh, oh, oh)\nOr am I caught in a hit-and-run?\nStraight up, now tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)\nOr are you just havin' fun?\n[Verse 2]\nTime's standing still\nWaiting for some small clue\n(Ah-let me tell ya now)\nI keep getting chills\nWhen I think your love (When I think your love) is true\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door\nHow about some information, please?\n\n[Chorus]\nStraight up, now tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)\nOr am I caught in a hit-and-run?\nStraight up, now tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)\nOr are you just havin' fun?\n\n[Bridge]\nYou are so hard to read\nYou play hide-and-seek\nWith your true intentions\nIf you're only playin' games\nI'll just have to say\nAbb-b-b-bye, b-b-b-bye\n[Breakdown]\nDo, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me, baby?)\nDo, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me? Ah-hey, baby!)\nDo, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me, baby?)\nC'mon now, do, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me?)\nAh-tell me, baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus - Extended]\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door\nAre you more than hot for me\nOr am I a page in your history book?\nI don't mean to make demands\nBut the word and the deed go hand in hand\nHow about some information, please?\n(Please, please, ah, please, please)\n\n[Chorus]\nStraight up, now tell me (Tell me)\nStraight up, now tell me (Tell me)\nStraight up, now tell me (Tell me)\nStraight up, now tell me\nStraight up, now tell me\nStraight up, now tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)\nOr am I caught in a hit-and-run?\nStraight up, now tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)\nOr are you just havin' fun?\nStraight up, now tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)\nOr am I caught in a hit-and-run?\nNow tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)\nOr are you just havin' fun?15Embed"
