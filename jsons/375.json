    "lyrics": "Shangri-la LyricsYour kisses take me to shangri-la\nEach kiss is magic\nThat makes my little world a Shangri-la\nA land of bluebirds and fountains\nAnd nothing to do\nBut cling to an angel that looks like you\nAnd when you hold me\nHow warm you are\nBe mine my darling\nAnd spend your life with me in Shangri-la\nFor anywhere you are is Shangri-la\nHow warm you are\nYou make my little world a Shangri-la\nFor anywhere you are is Shangri-laEmbed"
