(wooh)\n'Cause you don't really need me\nBut you keep me hangin' on\n\nWhy do you keep a-comin' around?\nPlaying with my heart\nWhy don't cha get out of my life\nAnd let me make a brand new start?\nLet me get over you\nThe way you've gotten over me, yeah\n\nSet me free why don't cha, babe?\nGet out my life why don't cha, babe? (wooh)\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\nNow you don't really need me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\nYou say although we broke up\nYou still just wanna be friends\nBut how can we still be friends\nWhen seeing you only breaks my heart again?\nAnd there ain't nothing I can do about it\n\nWhoa whoa whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa, yeah\n\nGet out, get out of my life\nAnd let me sleep at night\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\n\nYou say you still care for me\nBut your heart and soul needs to be free\nAnd now that you've got your freedom\nYou wanna still hold on to me\nYou don't want me for yourself\nSo let me find somebody else\n\nSet me free why don't cha, babe?\nGet out my life why don't cha, babe? (wooh)\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\nWhy don't cha be a man about it\nAnd set me free? (wooh)\nNow you don't care a thing about me\nYou're just using me, hey, abusing me\n\nGet out, get out of my life\nAnd let me sleep at night (wooh)\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on (wooh)"
