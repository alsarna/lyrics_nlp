(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\nWhy don't cha be a man about it\nAnd set me free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nNow you don't care a thing about me\nYou're just using me, hey, abusing me\nGet out, get out of my life\nAnd let me sleep at night (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)2Embed"
