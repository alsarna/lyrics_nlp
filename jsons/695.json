    "lyrics": "Tonight you're mine completely\nYou give your love so sweetly\nTonight the light of love is in your eyes\nBut will you love me tomorrow?\n\nIs this a lasting treasure\nOr just a moment's pleasure?\nCan I believe the magic of your sighs?\nWill you still love me tomorrow?\n\nTonight with words unspoken\nYou say that I'm the only one\nBut will my heart be broken\nWhen the night meets the morning sun?\n\nI'd like to know that your love\nIs love I can be sure of\nSo tell me now, and I won't ask again\nWill you still love me tomorrow?\n\nSo tell me now, and I won't ask again\nWill you still love me tomorrow?\nWill you still love me tomorrow?\nWill you still love me.."
