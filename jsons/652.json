    "lyrics": "There's nothing left for me of days that used to be\nThey're just a memory among my souvenirs\n\nSome letters sad and blue, a photograph or two\nI see a rose from you among my souvenirs\n\nA few more tokens rest within my treasure chest\nAnd though they do their best to give me consolation\n\nI count them all apart and as the teardrops start\nI find a broken heart among my souvenirs\n\nI count them all apart and as the teardrops start\nI find a broken heart among my souvenirs"
