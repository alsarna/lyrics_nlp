    "lyrics": "Purest Of Pain (a Puro Dolor) (spanglish) LyricsSorry didn't mean to call you but i couldn't fight it\nI guess i was weak, couldn't even hide it\nAnd so i surrendered, just to hear your voice\n\nDon't know how many times i said i'm gonna live without you\nAnd maybe someone else is standing there beside you\nBut there's something, baby you need to know\nThat deep inside me, i feel like i'm dying. i have to see you, it's all that i'm asking\n\n(chorus)\nVida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live\nThe air that i breathe\nCari?o mio, my world's become so empty. the days are so cold and lonely\nAnd each night i taste the purest of pain\n\nQuisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla\nQue no me ha afectado lo de tu partida\nPero con un dedo no se tapa el sol\nEstoy muriendo, muriendo por verte. agonizando, muy lento y muy fuerte\n\nVida, devuelveme mis fantasias, mis ganas de vivir la vida, devuelveme el aire\nCari?o mio, sin tin yo me siento vacio, las tardes son un laberinto, las noches\nMe saben, a puro dolor\n\n(chorus) (repeat chorus again softly)\nVida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live\nThe air that i breathe\nCari?o mio, my world's become so empty. the days are so cold and lonely\nAnd each night i taste the purest of pain\n\nI'm sorry i didn't mean to call you but i couldn't fight it\nI guess i was weak, couldn't even hide it\nAnd so i surrendered just to hear your voiceEmbed"
