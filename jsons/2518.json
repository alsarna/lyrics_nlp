    "lyrics": "Baby please\nBaby please don't take your love from me\nI am yours forever more\n'till eternity\nSilently please, listen to the words I say well\nI'm not talking just for play, listen to me please\n\nHeaven knows\nIt's not the way it should be\nHeaven knows\nIt's not the way it could be\nDon't you know\nThere's no need to leave\n\nHeaven knows\nI never wanna leave you\nHeaven knows\nI only wanna please you\nDon't you know\nLove is what I need\n\nDown inside\nDon't get caught with foolish pride\nPut all the other things aside\nThere's only you and me\nBelieve in us\nWe were always meant to be\nMe for you and you for me\n'till eternity\nHeaven knows\nIt's not the way it should be\nHeaven knows\nIt's not the way it could be\nDon't you know\nThere's no need to leave\n\nHeaven knows\nI only wanna love you\nHeaven knows\nI never wanna lose you\nDon't you know\nLove is meant to be\n\nHeaven knows\nIt's not the way it should be\nAnd it's no use now\nSo stop with the pretending\nSo come on child, and hear me\nWhen I cry..."
