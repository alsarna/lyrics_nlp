    "lyrics": "The ink is black\nThe page is white\nTogether we learn\nTo read and write\nTo read and write\nThe slate is black\nThe chalk is white\nThe words stand out\nSo clear and bright\nSo clear and bright\nA child is black\nA child is white\nThe whole world looks\nUp on the sight\nA beautiful sight\nAnd now a child\nCan understand\nThis is the law\nOf all the land\nAII the land\nAnd now at last\nWe plainly see\nThe alphabet\nOf Liberty\nLiberty\nA child is black\nA child is white\nThe whole world looks\nUp on this sight\nThe world is black\nThe world is white\nIt turns by day\nAnd then by night\nIt turns by night"
