    "lyrics": "MIRACLE OF LOVE\nEileen Rodgers\nA whippoorwill awakens\nAnd she tells the golden morn\nThat while the world was sleeping\nSome new whippoorwills were born\nShowing the lark and the dove\nAnother miracle of love\nA bee begins a buzzin'\nMakin' honey out of dew\nAnd roses by the dozen\nBloom where flowers never grew\nWarmed by the sun from above\nAnother miracle of love\nYes, I believe in miracles\nThat miracles come true\nDear, I believe in miracles\nJust look at me and you\nTwo strangers in the morning\nThen two friends this afternoon\nNow strangers in the morning\nAre two sweethearts 'neath the moon\nClose as a hand in a glove\nAnother miracle of love"
