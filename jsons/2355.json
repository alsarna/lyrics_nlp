    "lyrics": "You Made Me Believe in Magic LyricsI believed all love has gone\nI've no strength to carry on\nThought my world was upside down\n\nThen you walked on to my life\nWent to work to set things right\nWhat's the secret that you use\n\nYou made me believe in magic\nYou know that I can be true to your love\nYou made me believe in magic\nYour love's put magic into my life\n\nNow I'm filled with new sense to be\nYou gave my life harmony\nLoving you is all I need\nYou made me believe in magic\nYou know that I can be true to your love\nYou made me believe in magic\nYour love's put magic into my lifeEmbed"
