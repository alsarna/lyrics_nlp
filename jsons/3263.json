    "lyrics": "Need I say I love you?\nNeed I say I care?\nNeed I say that emotions\nAre something we don't share?\n\nI don't want to be sitting here\nTrying to deceive you\nCause you know I know baby\nThat I don't wanna go\n\nWe can not live together\nWe can not live apart\nAnd that's the situation\nWe've known it from the start\n\nEvery time that I look at you\nI can see the future\nCause you know I know baby\nThat I don't wanna go\n\nJust throwing it all away\nThrowing it all away\nIs there nothing that I can say\nTo make you change your mind?\nI watch the world go round and round\nAnd see mine turnin' upside down\nThrowing it all away\n\nNow who will light up your darkness?\nAnd who will hold your hand?\nWho will find you the answers\nWhen you don't understand?\n\nWhy should I have to be the one\nWho has to convince you?\nCause you know I know baby\nThat I don't wanna go\n\nThen some day you'll be sorry\nSomeday when you're free\nMemories will remind you\nThat our love was meant to be\n\nBut late at night when you call my name\nThe only sound you'll hear\nIs the sound of your voice calling\nCalling out to me\n\nJust throwing it all away\nThrowing it all away\nAnd there's nothing that I can say\nHey...\nWe're throwing it all away\n\nJust a throwing it all away\n\nJust a throwing it all away"
