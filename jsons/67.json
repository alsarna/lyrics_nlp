    "lyrics": "I went to your wedding\nAlthough I was dreading\nThe thought of losing you\n\nThe organ was playing\nMy poor heart kept saying\n\"Your dreams, your dreams are through\"\n\nYou came down the aisle\nWearing a smile\nA vision of loveliness\n\nI uttered a sigh\nWhispered goodbye\nGoodbye to my happiness\n\nYour mother was crying\nYour father was crying\nAnd I was crying too\n\nThe teardrops were falling\nBecause we were losing you\n\nYou came down the aisle\nWearing a smile\nA vision of loveliness\nI uttered a sigh\nThen whispered goodbye\nGoodbye to my happiness\n\nOh, your mother was crying\nYour father was crying\nAnd I was crying too\n\nThe teardrops were falling\nBecause we were losing you"
