    "lyrics": "Pretend you're happy when you're blue\nIt isn't very hard to do\nAnd you'll find happiness without an end\nWhenever you pretend\nRemember anyone can dream\nAnd nothing's as bad as it may seem\nThe little things you haven't got could be a lot if you pretend\nYou'll find a love you can share\nOne you can call all your own\nJust close your eyes she'll be there\nYou'll never be alone\nAnd if you sing this melody\nYou'll be pretending just like me\nThe world is mine it can be yours my friend\nSo why don't you pretend"
