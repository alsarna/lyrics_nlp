    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWalkin' down the street, smoggy-eyed\nLooking at the sky, starry-eyed\nSearchin' for the place, weary-eyed\nCrying in the night, teary-eyed\n\n[Hook] x2\nDon't you know that it's true\nThat for me and for you\nThe world is a ghetto\n\n[Verse 2]\nWonder when I'll find paradise\nSomewhere there's a home sweet and nice\nWonder if I'll find happiness\nNever give it up now I guess\n\n[Hook] x2\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's no need to search anywhere\nHappiness is here, have your share\nIf you know you're loved, be secure\nParadise is love to be sure\n\n[Hook] x4"
