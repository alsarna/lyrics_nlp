    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nIn a white room with black curtains near the station\nBlack roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings\nSilver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes\nDawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment\nI'll wait in this place where the sun never shines\nWait in this place where the shadows run from themselves\nYou said no strings could secure you at the station\nPlatform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows\nI walked into such a sad time at the station\nAs I walked out, felt my own need just beginning\nI'll wait in the queue when the trains come back\nLie with you where the shadows run from themselves\n\n[Bridge]\n\nAt the party she was kindness in the hard crowd\nConsolation for the old wound now forgotten\nYellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes\nShe's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings\n\nI'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;\nLie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves\n[Outro]"
