    "lyrics": "Oh, my love, my darling\nI've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time\nTime goes by so slowly and time can do so much\nAre you still mine?\nI need your love, I need your love, God speed your love to me\n\nLonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea\nTo the open arms of the sea\nLonely rivers sigh, \"Wait for me, wait for me\"\n\"I'll be coming home, wait for me!\"\n\nAre you still mine?\nI need your love, I need your love, God speed your love to me"
