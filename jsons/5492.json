Where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the end\nEveryone ends up alone\nLosing her\nThe only one who's ever known\nWho I am\nWho I'm not, and who I wanna be\nNo way to know\nHow long she will be next to me\n\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure\nYou found me, you found me\nLying on the floor\nSurrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n[Bridge]\nFor early morning\nThe city breaks\nAnd I've been calling\nFor years and years and years and years\nAnd you never left me no messages\nYou never send me no letters\nYou got some kind of nerve\nTaking all I want\n\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure\nYou found me, you found me\nLying on the floor\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nLost and insecure\nYou found me, you found me\nLying on the floor\nSurrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n\n[Outro]\nWhy'd you have to wait\nTo find me? To find me?45Embed"
