    "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\nIn a bar in Toledo\nAcross from the depot\nOn a bar stool she took off her ring\nI thought I'd get closer\nSo I walked on over\nI sat down and asked her name\n\nWhen the drinks finally hit her\nShe said I'm no quitter\nBut I finally quit living on dreams\nI'm hungry for laughter\nAnd here ever after\nI'm after whatever the other life brings\n\nIn the mirror I saw him\nAnd I closely watched him\nI thought how he looked out of place\nHe came to the woman\nWho sat there beside me\nHe had a strange look on his face\n\nThe big hands were calloused\nHe looked like a mountain\nFor a minute I thought I was dead\nBut he started shaking\nHis big heart was breaking\nHe turned to the woman and said\n[Chorus:]\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille\nWith four hungry children\nAnd a crop in the field\nI've had some bad times\nLived through some sad times\nBut this time you're hurting won't heal\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille\n\n[Verse 2:]\nAfter he left us\nI ordered more whiskey\nI thought how she'd made him look small\nFrom the lights of the bar room\nTo a rented hotel room\nWe walked without talkin' at all\n\nShe was a beauty\nBut when she came to me\nShe must have thought I'd lost my mind\nI couldn't hold her\n'Cuz the words that he told her\nKept coming back time after time\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille\nWith four hungry children\nAnd a crop in the field\nI've had some bad times\nLived through some sad times\nBut this time you're hurting won't heal\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille\nWith four hungry children\nAnd a crop in the field\nI've had some bad times\nLived through some sad times\nBut this time you're hurting won't heal\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"
