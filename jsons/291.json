    "lyrics": "I hear the cottonwoods whisperin' above\n\"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love\"\nThe ole hooty-owl hooty-hoos to the dove\n\"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love\"\n\nDoes my lover feel what I feel\nWhen he comes near?\nMy heart beats so joyfully\nYou'd think that he could hear\n\nWish I knew if he knew what I'm dreamin' of\n\"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love\"\n\nWhippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know\nTammy, Tammy can't let him go\nThe breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low\n\"Tammy, Tammy, you love him so\"\n\nWhen the night is warm, soft and warm\nI long for his charms\nI'd sing like a violin\nIf I were in his arms\n\nWish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of\n\"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love\""
