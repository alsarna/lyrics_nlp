    "lyrics": "I Like Dreaminâ€™ LyricsI like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine\nI like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine\nWhen the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight\nGot you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light\n\nI see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine\nWe've walked along St. Thomas beach a million times\nHand in hand, two barefoot lovers kissing in the sand\nSide by side, the tide rolls in\nI'm touching you, you're touching me\nIf only it could be\n\nI like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine\nI like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine\nWhen the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight\nGot you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light\nThrough each dream, how our love has grown\nI see us with our children and our happy home\nLittle smiles, so warm and tender looking up at us\nBlessed by love, the one we shared\nTill I wake, and reach for you\nAnd you're just not there\n\nI like dreamin' 'cause dreaming can make you mine\nI like holding you close and touching your skin\nEven if it's in my mind\nOh, sweet dream baby, I love you\nOh, my sweet dream baby, you're in my dreams every night\nOh sweet dreams, I like feelin you\nOh sweet dreams baby, Don't keep me waiting all my life1Embed"
