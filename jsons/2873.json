    "lyrics": "{Intro}\n\n[Verse 1]\nWatching girls go passing by\nIt ain't the latest thing\nI'm just standing in a doorway\nI'm just trying to make some sense'\nOut of these girls that passing by\nThe tales they tell of men\nI'm not waiting on a lady\nI'm just waiting on a friend\n\n[Verse 2]\nA smile relieves a heart that grieves\nRemember what I said\nI'm not waiting on a lady\nI'm just waiting on a friend\nJust waiting on a friend\nI'm just waiting on a friend\nI'm just waiting on a friend\n\n{Bridge}\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't need a whore, I don't need no booze\nDon't need a virgin priest\nBut I need someone I can cry to\nI need someone to protect\nMaking love and breaking hearts\nIt is a game for youth\nBut I'm not waiting on my lady\nI'm just waiting on a friend\n[Outro]\nI'm just waiting on a friend\nI'm just waiting on a friend\nI'm just waiting on a friend\nI'm just waiting on a friend\nJust waiting on a friend\nWaiting on a friend\nWaiting on a friend"
