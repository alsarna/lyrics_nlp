    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI see a red door and I want it painted black\nNo colours anymore, I want them to turn black\nI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes\nI have to turn my head until my darkness goes\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see a line of cars and they're all painted black\nWith flowers and my love, both never to come back\nI see people turn their heads and quickly look away\nLike a newborn baby, it just happens every day\n\n[Verse 3]\nI look inside myself and see my heart is black\nI see my red door, I must have it painted black\nMaybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts\nIt's not easy facing up when your whole world is black\n\n[Verse 4]\nNo more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue\nI could not foresee this thing happening to you\nIf I look hard enough into the setting sun\nMy love will laugh with me before the morning comes\n\n[Verse 1]\nI see a red door and I want it painted black\nNo colours anymore, I want them to turn black\nI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes\nI have to turn my head until my darkness goes\n[Bridge]\n\n[Outro]\nI wanna see your face, painted black\nBlack as night, black as coal\nI wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky\nI wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black\nYeah\n\n[Bridge]"
