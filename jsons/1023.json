I wanna know\nHow can I tell if he loves me so?\n(Is it in his eyes?)\nOh no, you'll be deceived\n(Is it in his eyes?)\nOh no, he'll make believe\nIf you wanna know if he loves you so\nIt's in his kiss\n(That's where it is, oh yeah)\n(Or is it in his face?)\nOh no, it's just his charm\n(In his one embrace)\nOh no, that's just his arm\nIf you wanna know if he loves you so\nIt's in his kiss\n(That's where it is)\nOh oh, it's in his kiss\n(That's where it is)\nOh oh oh, kiss him and squeeze him tight\nAnd find out what you wanna know\nIf it's love, if it really is\nIt's there in his kiss\n(How 'bout the way he acts)\nOh no, that's not the way\nAnd you're not listenin' to all I say\nIf you wanna know if he loves you so\nIt's in his kiss\n(That's where it is)\nOh yeah, it's in his kiss\n(That's where it is)\nWhoa oh oh, kiss him and squeeze him tight\nAnd find out what you wanna know\nIf it's love, if it really is\nIt's there in his kiss\n(How 'bout the way he acts)\nOh no, that's not the way\nAnd you're not listenin' to all I say\nIf you wanna know if he loves you so\nIt's in his kiss\n(That's where it is)\nOh yeah, it's in his kiss\n(That's where it is)\nOh oh, it's in his kiss\n(That's where it is)"
