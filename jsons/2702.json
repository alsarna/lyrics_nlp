    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI don't wanna talk\nAbout things we've gone through\nThough it's hurting me, now it's history\nI've played all my cards\nAnd that's what you've done, too\nNothing more to say, no more ace to play\n\n[Chorus]\nThe winner takes it all\nThe loser's standing small\nBeside the victory\nThat's her destiny\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was in your arms\nThinking I belonged there\nI figured it made sense, building me a fence\nBuilding me a home\nThinking I'd be strong there\nBut I was a fool playing by the rules\n\n[Chorus]\nThe gods may throw a dice\nTheir minds as cold as ice\nAnd someone way down here\nLoses someone dear\nThe winner takes it all (Takes it all)\nThe loser has to fall (Has to fall)\nIt's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)\nWhy should I complain? (Why complain)\n[Verse 3]\nBut tell me, does she kiss\nLike I used to kiss you?\nDoes it feel the same when she calls your name?\nSomewhere deep inside\nYou must know I miss you\nBut what can I say? Rules must be obeyed\n\n[Chorus]\nThe judges will decide (They decide)\nThe likes of me abide (We abide)\nSpectators of the show (Of the show)\nAlways staying low (Staying low)\nThe game is on again (On again)\nA lover or a friend (Or a friend)\nA big thing or a small (Big or small)\nThe winner takes it all (Takes it all)\n\n[Verse 4]\nI don't wanna talk\nIf it makes you feel sad\nAnd I understand, you've come to shake my hand\nI apologise\nIf it makes you feel bad\nSeeing me so tense, no self-confidence\n[Bridge]\nBut you see, the winner takes it all\nThe winner takes it all\n\n[Outro]\n(So the winner)\n(Takes it all)\n(And the loser)\n(Has to fall)\n(Throw a dice)\n(Cold as ice)\n(Way down here)\n(Someone dear)\n(Takes it all)\n(Has to fall)\n(It seems plain)\n(Why complain)"
