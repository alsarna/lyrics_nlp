Sia) Legendado LyricsYou shout it loud\nBut I can't hear a word you say\nI'm talking loud not saying much\nI'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet\nYou shoot me down, but I get up\n\nI'm bulletproof, nothing to lose\nFire away, fire away\nRicochets, you take your aim\nFire away, fire away\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\n\nCut me down\nBut it's you who'll have further to fall\nGhost town, haunted love\nRaise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones\nI'm talking loud not saying much\nI'm bullet proof, nothing to lose\nFire away, fire away\nRicochets, you take your aim\nFire away, fire away\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\nI am titanium\nI am titanium\n\nStone hard, machine gun\nFiring at the ones who rise\nStone hard, as bulletproof glass\n\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\nYou shoot me down but I won't fall\nI am titanium\nI am titaniumEmbed"
