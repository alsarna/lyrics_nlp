    "lyrics": "Every day when the work is behind you\nAnd the shop and the store put the lock on the door\nJust get away where your worries won't find you\nIf you like, well, I'll tell you more\n\nDon't let the day get the better of you\nWhen the evening comes, there's so much to do!\nYou'd better put on your best and wear a smile\nCome along with me a while\n'cause I tell you\n\nCHORUS:\nI know a place\nWhere the music is fine and the lights are always low!\nI know a place\nWhere we can go\n\nAt the door there's a man who will greet you\nThen you go downstairs to some tables and chairs\nSoon, I'm sure, you'll be tapping your feet\nBecause the beat is the greatest there\n\nAll around there are girls and boys\nIt's a swingin' place\nA cellar full of noise!\nIt's got an atmosphere of its own somehow\nYou gotta come along right now!\n'Cause I tell you\nCHORUS\n\n- musical interlude -\n\nWell, all around there are girls and boys\nIt's a swingin' place\nA cellar full of noise\nIt's got an atmosphere of its own somehow\nYou've gotta come along right now!\n'Cause I tell you\n\nCHORUS\n\nI know a place where we can go!\nI know a place where the lights are low!\nI know a place where we can go!\nI know a place where the lights are low!\n(repeat and fade out)"
