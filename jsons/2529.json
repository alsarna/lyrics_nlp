No, child, no\n[Non-demonic violin piece]\n[Verse 4]\nThe Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\nAnd he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet\nJohnny said, \"Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again\nI done told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.\"\nAnd he played:\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Fire on the Mountain\" Run, boys, run!\nThe Devil's in the house of the rising sun\nChicken's in the bread pan picking out dough\nGranny, will your dog bite? No, child, no19Embed"
