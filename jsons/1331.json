    "lyrics": "This Is My Song LyricsWhy is my heart so light\nWhy are the stars so bright\nWhy is the sky so blue\nSince the hour I met you\n\nFlowers are smiling bright\nSmiling for our delight\nSmiling so tenderly\nFor the world, you and me\n\nI know why the world is smiling\nSmiling so tenderly\nIts just the same old story\nThru all eternity\n\nLove, this is my song\nHere is a song, a serenade to you\nThe world cannot be wrong\nIf in this world there's you\nI care not what the world may say\nWithout your love there is no day\nSo Love, this is my song\nHere is a song, a serenade to youEmbed"
