Dig\n\n[Verse 2]\nLookin' at you, lookin' at me\nThe way you move, you know it's easy to see\nThe neon light's on me tonight\nI've got a way, we're gonna prove it tonight\nLike Romeo to Juliet\nTime and time, I'm gonna make you mine\nI've had enough, we've had enough\nIt's all the same, she said\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI knew right from the beginning\nThat you would end up winnin'\nI knew right from the start\nYou'd put an arrow through my heart\n\n[Chorus]\nRound and round\nWith love we'll find a way just give it time\nRound and round\nWhat comes around goes around\nI'll tell you why\nYeah!\n\n[Solo]\n\n[Verse 1]\nOut on the streets, that's where we'll meet\nYou make the night, I always cross the line\nTightened our belts, abuse ourselves\nGet in our way, we'll put you on your shelf\n\n[Chorus]\nRound and round\nWith love we'll find a way just give it time\nRound and round\nWhat comes around goes around\nI'll tell you why\n\n[Chorus]\nRound and round\nWith love we'll find a way just give it time, time, time, time\nRound and round\nWhat comes around goes around\nI'll tell you why, why, why, why\nRound and round3Embed"
