    "lyrics": "It Must Be Him LyricsI tell myself what's done is done\nI tell myself don't be a fool\nPlay the field have a lot of fun\nIt's easy when you play it cool\n\nI tell myself don't be a chump\nWho cares, let him stay away\nThat's when the phone rings and I jump\nAnd as I grab the phone I pray\n\nLet it please be him, oh dear God\nIt must be him or I shall die\nOr I shall die\nOh hello, hello my dear God\nIt must be him but it's not him\nAnd then I die\nThat's when I die\nAfter a while, I'm myself again\nI take the pieces off the floor\nPut my heart on the shelf again\nYou'll never hurt me anymore\n\nI'm not a puppet on a string\nI'll find somebody else someday\nThat's when the phone rings, and once again\nI start to pray\n\nLet it please be him, oh dear God\nIt must be him , it must be him\nOr I shall die, Or I shall die\nOh hello, hello my dear God\nIt must be him but it's not him\nAnd then I die\nThat's when I die1Embed"
