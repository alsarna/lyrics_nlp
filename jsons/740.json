    "lyrics": "Take Good Care of Her LyricsI suppose I ought to say congratulations\nFor you've won the only girl\nI ever loved\n\nBut I hurt too much to face the situation\nJust take good care of her\nTake good care of her\n\nJust to be around her\nWas my greatest pleasure\nShe was everything\nMy future held in store\n\nSo, remember\nWhen you take my only treasure\nPlease, take good care of her\nTake good care of her\nI must accept it\nShe loves you more than me\nSo with my broken heart\nI'll bow out gracefully\n\nPlease don't send me\nAny wedding invitation\nFor I couldn't bear to see her there with you\n\nIf she's happy\nThat will be my consolation\nSo, take good care of her\nTake good care of her\n\nTake good care of her\nTake good care of herEmbed"
