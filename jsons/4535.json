    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen all our tears have reached the sea\nPart of you will live in me\nWay down deep inside my heart\nThe days keep coming without fail\nA new wind is going to find your sail\nThat's where your journey starts\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll find better love\nStrong as it ever was\nDeep as the river runs\nWarm as the morning sun\nPlease remember me\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust like the waves down by the shore\nWe're going to keep on coming back for more\nCause we don't ever want to stop\nOut in this brave new world you seek\nOh the valleys and the peaks\nAnd I can see you on the top\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll find better love\nStrong as it ever was\nDeep as the river runs\nWarm as the morning sun\nPlease remember me\n[Verse 3]\nRemember me when you're out walking\nWhen the snow falls high outside your door\nLate at night when you're not sleeping\nAnd moonlight falls across your floor\nWhen I can't hurt you anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll find better love\nStrong as it ever was\nDeep as the river runs\nWarm as the morning sun\nPlease remember me\nPlease remember me"
