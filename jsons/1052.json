    "lyrics": "Itâ€™s Over LyricsYour baby doesn't love you anymore\nGolden days before they end\nWhisper secrets to the wind\nYour baby won't be near you any more\n\nTender nights before they fly\nSend falling stars that seem to cry\nYour baby doesn't want you anymore\nIt's over\n\nIt breaks your heart in two, To know she's been untrue\nBut oh what will you do? Then she said to you\nThere's someone new We're through We're through\nIt's over It's over It's over\n\nAll the rainbows in the sky\nStart to weep, then say goodbye\nYou won't be seeing rainbows any more\nSetting suns before they fall, Echo to you that's all that's all\nBut you'll see lonely sunset after all\nIt's over It's over It's over It's overEmbed"
