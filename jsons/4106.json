    "lyrics": "I Believe LyricsWalk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand\nDon't ask any questions and don't try to understand\nOpen up your mind and then open up your heart\nAnd you will see that you and me aren't very far apart\n\n'Cause I believe that love is the answer\nI believe that love will find the way\n\nViolence is spread worldwide and there's families on-the street\nAnd we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see\nThat all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today\nMoney is our incentive now so that makes it okay\n\nBut I believe that love is the answer\nI believe that love will find the way\nI believe that love is the answer\nI believe that love will find the way\nOoooh\n\nI've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year\nShe said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear\nThat one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love\nWith a nigga from the streets\nOh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me\n'Cause she believes that love will see it through\nAnd one day he'll understand\nAnd he'll see me as a person and not just a black man\n\n'Cause I believe that love is the answer\nI believe that love will find the way\nI believe I believe I believe I believe that love is the answer\nI believe that love will find the way\nLove will find the way (x7)Embed"
