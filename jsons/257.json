    "lyrics": "My dearest, my darling, tomorrow is near\nThe sun will bring showers of sadness I fear\nYou lips won't be smiling, your eyes will not shine\nFor I know tomorrow that your love won't be mine\n\nIt's almost tomorrow, but what can I do\nYour kisses all tell me that your love is untrue\nI'll love you forever till stars cease to shine\nAnd hope someday darling, that you'll always be mine\n\nYou heart was so warm dear, It now has turned cold\nYou no longer love me, for your memories grow old\nIt's almost tomorrow, for here comes the sun\nBut still I am hoping that tomorrow won't come\n\nIt's almost tomorrow, but what can I do\nYour kisses all tell me that your love is untrue\nI'll love you forever, till stars cease to shine\nAnd hope someday darling, that you'll always be mine"
