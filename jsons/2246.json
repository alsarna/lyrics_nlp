    "lyrics": "Baby Face LyricsBaby face, youve got the cutest little baby face\nThere's not another one can take your place\nBaby face-my poor heart is jumping\nYouve really started something, Baby race\nI'm up in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace\nI didn't need a shove, cause I just fell in love\nWith your pretty baby faceEmbed"
