    "lyrics": "My Happiness LyricsEvening shadows make me blue\nWhen each weary day is through\nHow I long to be with you, my happiness\n\nEvery day I reminisce\nDreaming of your tender kiss\nAlways thinking how I miss my happiness\n\nA million years it seems\nHave gone by since we shared our dreams\nBut I'll hold you again\nThere'll be no blue memories then\n\nWhether skies are gray or blue\nAny place on earth will do\nJust as long as I'm with you, my happiness\nWhether skies are gray or blue\nAny place on earth will do\nJust as long as I'm with you, my happinessEmbed"
