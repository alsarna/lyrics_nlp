Hey you! Who said that?\nBaby, how you been?\nYou say you don't know\nYou won't know until you begin\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo can't you see me standing here?\nI've got my back against the record machine\nI ain't the worst that you've seen\nOh, can't you see what I mean?\n[Chorus]\nAh, might as well jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nMight as well jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nJump!\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Keyboard Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nMight as well jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nGet it and jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\n\n[Outro]\nJump\nJump\nJump\nJump"
