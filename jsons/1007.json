    "lyrics": "I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night\nWhen an XKE pulled up on the right\nAnd rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag\nAnd challenged me then and there to a drag\nI said, \"You're on, buddy, my mill's runnin' fine\nLet's come off the line now, at Sunset and Vine\nBut I'll throw you one better if you've got the nerve\nLet's race all the way\nTo Dead Man's Curve\"\n\nDead Man's Curve, it's no place to play\nDead Man's Curve, you best keep away\nDead Man's Curve, I can hear 'em say\nWon't come back from Dead Man's Curve\n\nThe street was deserted late Friday night\nWe were buggin' each other while we sat out the light\nWe both popped the clutch when the light turned green\nYou should of heard the whine from my screamin' machine\nI flew past LaBrea, Schwab's, and Crescent Heights\nAnd all the Jag could see were my six tail lights\nHe passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve\nBut I pulled her out and there I was\nAt Dead Man's Curve\n\nDead Man's Curve, it's no place to play\nDead Man's Curve\nWell, the last thing I remember, Doc, I started to swerve\nAnd then I saw the Jag slide into the curve\nI know I'll never forget that horrible sight\nI guess I found out for myself that everyone was right\nWon't come back from Dead Man's Curve\n\nDead Man's Curve, it's no place to play\nDead Man's Curve, you best keep away\nDead Man's Curve, I can hear 'em say\nWon't come back from Dead Man's Curve"
