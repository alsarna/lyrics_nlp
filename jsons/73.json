    "lyrics": "Blacksmith Blues LyricsDown in old Kentucky\nWhere horseshoes are lucky\nThere's a village smithy standin' under a chestnut tree\nHear the hammer knockin'\nSee the hammer rockin'\nHe sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes\nSee the hot sparks a-flyin'\nLike Fourth of July-in'\nHe's even got the horses cloppin', pop! down the avenue\nFolks love the rhythm\nThe clang-bangin' rhythm\nYou'll get a lot o' kicks out of the Blacksmith BluesEmbed"
