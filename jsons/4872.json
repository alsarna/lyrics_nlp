    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHad a nice little life\nA little boat a little beach\nA little routine I liked\nA blue ocean view\nFree to go with the flow\nAnywhere that I wanted to\nBut the moment you set foot on my shore\nThat's when I knew\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a difference in living and living well\nYou can't have it all all by yourself\nSomething's always missing\nTill you share it with someone else\nThere's a difference in living and living well\n\n[Verse 2]\nTill you sailed with me\nThought that I had it good\nAs good as it could be\nFrom the back of my deck\nCaught a fish caught a breeze\nAnd a thousand red sunsets\nBut sitting here with you girl I just saw\nThe best one yet\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nMy days are brighter\nMy sky a deeper blue\nMy nights are sweeter\nWhen I'm with you\n\n\n[Chorus]"
