    "lyrics": "You and I will make each night the first\nEveryday a beginning\nSpirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed\nThey warm and excite us\n'Cause we have the brightest love\nTwo lights that shine as one\nMorning glory and midnight sun\nTime we've learned to sail above\nTime won't change the meaning of one love\nAgeless and ever, ever, ever, evergreen"
