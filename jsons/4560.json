I see)\nWhat the woman is feeling\nWas it someone from a distant past? (way back long ago)\n'Cause it's breaking my heart\nTo watch her stare into the glass (Joe help me out!)\n\n[Verse 2: Joe]\nAs she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face\nI could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way\nThen she stopped and she came to a page where her diary ends\nTo smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIn a tattered picture book (tattered picture book)\nWas a photograph she took (she took) years ago\n(Secret memories in her mind)\nSecret memories in her mind, (oh oh)\nHow could love be so unkind? (unkind)\nHeartbreak time\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFaded pictures in a broken glass (Oh baby)\nLike a mirror revealing (Like a mirror revealing)\nWhat the woman is feeling\n(was it someone from a distant past?)\nWas it someone from a distant past? (Oh oh)\n'Cause it's breaking my heart (it's breaking my heart)\nTo watch her stare into the glass (stare into the glass)\n[Interlude (x2)]\n(Oh na na na na)\nJust keep spinning\nAs she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting\n'Cause she's lost inside the past\n\n(lost inside the past)\n[Chorus]\nFaded pictures in a broken glass (in a broken glass)\nLike a mirror revealing (I feel it)\nWhat the woman is feeling\nWas it someone from a distant past? (way back long ago)\n'Cause it's breaking my heart\n(You're breaking my... breaking my...)\nTo watch her stare into the glass (my heart is broke girl...)\n\nFaded pictures in a broken glass2Embed"
