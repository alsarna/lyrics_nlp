    "lyrics": "I'm in love with a dolly named 'Glendora'\nShe works in the window of a big department stor-a!\nEyes of blue, hair like gold\nNever been young, but she'll never get old . . \nOh Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you!\n\nO' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . \nO' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you!\n\nShe's so shy that I don't know how I found her\nWith three big body guards always workin' around her!\nOne just nods, an' two just grins\nAn' three got a mouth full of safety pins . . \nO' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you!\n( You . . . more of you! )\n\nO' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . \nO' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you!\n( . . . more of you! )\n\nI stand left an' I stand right\nOutta my head 'cause I'm outta sight . . \nO' Glendora . . . I wanna see more of you!\n\nLate last night at the store they did some changin' . . \nAn' I stood watchin' when they started re-arrangin' . . \nShe lost her wig, she lost her arms\nAn' when they got through she lost all of her charms\nO' Glendora . . . what did they do to you?\nWhat they do, what they do, what they do ?\nO' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . \nO' Glendora . . . what did they do to you?\n\nWhat they do, what they do, what they do ?\nO' Glendora . . . O' Glendora . . \nO' Glendora . . . what did they do to you?\n\nDo to you, oh what did they do to you?\nO' Glendora . . . what did they do to you?"
