Mm\nThen that time I went and said goodbye\nNow I'm back and not ashamed to cry\nOoh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Ayy\n\n[Chorus]\nHere I am, baby, oh, oh\nSigned, sealed, delivered, I'm yours\n(You got my future in your hands)\nAh, here I am, baby, ah, ah\nSigned, sealed, delivered, I'm yours\n[Bridge]\nYou got my future in your hands, hey, hey\nI've done a lot of foolish things\nThat I really didn't mean, ayy, hey, yeah, yeah\nDidn't I? Oh baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeen a lot of things in this old world\nWhen I touch them, they mean nothing, girl\nOoh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!\nAh, I’m yours!\nOoh wee baby, you set my soul on fire\nThat's why I know you're my heart's only desire\nOoh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
