    "lyrics": "She sits on the dock a fishin' in the water, uh huh\nI don't know her name she's the fisherman's daughter, uh huh\nCome on down to my boat, baby\nCome on down where we can play\nCome on down to my boat baby\nCome on down, we'll sail away\n\nShe smiled so nice like she wants to come with me, uh huh\nBut she's tied to the dock and she can't get free\nCome on down to my boat, baby\nCome on down where we can play\nCome on down to my boat, baby\nCome on down, we'll sail away\n\nFish all day, sleep all night\nFather never lets her out of his sight\nSoon I'm gonna have to get my knife and cut that rope (cut that rope)\n\nThen we can go fishin' in my little red boat\nMake you happy in my little red boat\nSo come on down to my boat baby\nCome on down where we can play\nCome on down to my boat, baby\nCome on down, we'll sail away\n\nCome on down to my boat, baby\nCome on down where we can play\nCome on down to my boat, baby\nCome on down we'll sail away"
