    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGot on board a westbound seven forty-seven\nDidn't think before deciding what to do\nOoh, that talk of opportunities\nTV breaks and movies\nRang true, sure rang true\n\n[Chorus]\nSeems it never rains in southern California\nSeems I've often heard that kind of talk before\nIt never rains in California\nBut girl, don't they warn ya?\nIt pours, man, it pours\n\n[Verse 2]\nOut of work, I'm out of my head\nI'm out of self respect, I'm out of bread\nI'm under-loved, I'm underfed\nI wanna go home\n\n[Chorus 2]\nIt never rains in California\nBut girl, don't they warn ya?\nIt pours, man, it pours\n\n[Verse 3]\nWill you tell the folks back home I nearly made it?\nHad offers but didn't know which one to take\nPlease don't tell 'em how you found me\nDon't tell 'em how you found me\nGimme a break, give me a break\n[Chorus]\nSeems it never rains in southern California\nSeems I've often heard that kind of talk before\nIt never rains in California\nBut girl, don't they warn ya?\nIt pours, man, it pours"
