    "lyrics": "Why this feeling? Why this glow?\nWhy the thrill when you say hello?\nIt's a strange and tender magic you do\nMister Wonderful, that's you\n\nWhy this trembling when you speak\nWhy this joy when you touch my cheek?\nI must tell you what my heart knows is true\nMister Wonderful, that's you\n\nAnd why this longing to know your charms\nTo spend forever here in your arms\n\nOh there's much more I could say\nBut the words keep slipping away\nAnd I'm left with one point of view\nMister Wonderful, that's you\n\nOne more thing, then I'm through\nMister Wonderful\nMister Wonderful\nMister Wonderful, I love you!"
