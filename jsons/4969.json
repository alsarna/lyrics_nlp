We don't need this war\nBut I say there's some things worth fightin' for\nWhat about our freedom and this piece of ground?\nWe didn't get to keep em' by backing down\nThey say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in\nBefore you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend\n\nChorus\nHave you forgotten how it felt that day\nTo see your homeland under fire\nAnd her people blown away\nHave you forgotten when those towers fell\nWe had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell\nAnd you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden\nHave you forgotten?\nThey took all the footage off my TV\nSaid it's too disturbin for you and me\nIt'll just breed anger is what the experts say\nIf it was up to me I'd show it every day\nSome say this country's just out lookin' for a fight\nWell after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right\n\nChorus\nHave you forgotten how it felt that day\nTo see your homeland under fire\nAnd her people blown away\nHave you forgotten when those towers fell\nWe had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell\nAnd we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden\nHave you forgotten?\n\nI'v been there with the soldiers\nWho've gone away to war\nAnd you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for\n\nHave you forgotten\nAll the people killed\nYes some went down like heroes\nIn that Pennsylvania field\nHave you forgotten\nAbout our Pentagon\nAll the loved ones that we lost\nAnd those left to carry on\nDon't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden\nHave you forgotten?\n\nHave you forgotten?\n\nHave you forgotten?!1Embed"
