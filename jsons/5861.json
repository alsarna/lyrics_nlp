No! No! God, no! )\nYou're my-you're my (Friend?) friend\n(Friend, friend, friend,life-long)\nThank you for being my friend\n\n[Chorus]\nRed Solo cup\n(That's what I am talking about)\nI fill you up\nLet's have a party\n(Let's have a party)\nLet's have a party\n(Let's have a party)\nI love you, red Solo cup\nI lift you up\nProceed to party\nProceed to party\n\nRed Solo cup\nRed Solo cup\n(I fill you up, let's have a party)\nLet's have a party\n(Let's have a party)\nLet's have a party\n(Red Solo cup)\nOh red Solo cup\n(I lift you up)\nLet's have a party\nProceed to party yeah yeah\n[Outro]\n(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)\n(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)\n(Solo cup, solo cup)2Embed"
