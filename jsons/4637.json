Yeah\nAnd I feel like a newborn\nAnd I feel like a newborn\n(Kicking and screaming)\n\n[Chorus]\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nHey, dad, what do you think about your son now?\nHey, dad, what do you think about your son now?\n[Chorus]\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture? (I won't remember)\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture?\n'Cause I won't remember\nCould you take my picture? (I won't remember)\n'Cause I won't remember, yeah8Embed"
