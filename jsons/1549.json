    "lyrics": "Baby, is he looking after you?\nIs he showing you the same love, the warm love\nJust like we knew?\n\nBaby, baby, it's you I'm thinking of\nIn the morning when I wake up\nIn the evening, it's you that I dream of\n\nSometimes love hurts, and sometimes love's unkind\nAnd sometimes you might feel blue\nBut remember now, darling, if his words are real\nThis will never, never happen to you\n\nBaby, baby, there's things I'd like to say\nI was hoping that with our love\nWe would get married someday\n\nBaby, baby, it's you I'm thinking of\nIn the morning when I wake up\nIn the evening, it's you that I dream of\n\nSometimes love hurts, and sometimes love's unkind\nAnd sometimes you might feel blue\nBut remember now, baby, if his words are real\nThis will never, never happen to you\nBaby, baby, there's things I'd like to say\nI was hoping that with our love\nWe would get married someday"
