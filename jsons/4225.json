Vince, Monica, Stacey and my damn brother\nIt bothers me knowing my children are never gonna meet their grandmother\nI just want to cry\nActually I want to die\nCause the day you passed away I bottled it all up inside\nA couple days ago was Mothers Day\nBut you weren’t here to celebrate\nThey say that when you die, you always make it to a better place\nThat may be true, but without you I don’t know how I’ll make it through\nYou always said you loved me\nBut I never said the same to you\n[You+Me – Break The Cycle]\nCircles and cycles and seasons\nFor everything there’s always reason\nBut it’s never good\nNever turns out as it should\n\nAnd now I lay awake and reminisce everything that you did for me\nIf God is real, then how can any of this crap be meant to be?\nI love you so much, now I’ll never gonna be able to tell you that\nJust to see your face again, I’ll go through frickin’ hell and back\nBut I know you never coming back\nI wish I had my mother back\nYou’re the only reason that I’m breathing, only reason that I want to rap\nEverybody want to be able to hold me back and try to keep me on the ground\nThey say that God is real, and I keep looking but he’s not around\nAin’t nobody ever gonna be able to save me, I can’t save my frickin’ myself\nNeed some major help\nCuz I don’t want to burn inside the flames of hell\nEverything you do in life, is gotta be for something right\nThink I need to go to bed and deal with the pain another night\nI don’t even want to write\nBut I gotta be able to cope with the pain\nSo I say to hell with a broken heart, I got a broken brain\nI just want to walk away\nBut I still got a lot to say\nBut I feel like I’m better off dead, or put in jail and locked away\n[You+Me – Break The Cycle]\nCircles and cycles and seasons\nFor everything there’s always reason\nBut it’s never good\nNever turns out as it shouldEmbed"
