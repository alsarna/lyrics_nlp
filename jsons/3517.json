This love could be so much more\nIt's well worth the waiting for, yeah\nMy resistance is weakening\nEvery time we touch\nCause baby you've got everything\nEverything That I've been dreaming of\n\n(guitar solo)\n\nDon't rush me. I've made that mistake before\nOh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more\nIt's well worth the waiting for\nDon't rush me. I've made that mistake before\nOh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more\nIt's well worth the waiting for, yeahEmbed"
