    "lyrics": "What do you do when it's falling apart\nAnd you knew it was gone from the very start\nDo you close your eyes and dream about me\n\nA girl in love with a gleam in her eye\nI was a younger boy all dressed in white\nWe're older now, Do you still think about me\n\nI remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet\nWell it felt so good to be young, feels like yesterday\n\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\nDo you still dream about me\n\nI guess I don't know what I'm thinking\nComing off a hard night of drinking\nAngie come closer to me, I need a soul to bleed on\n\nIt coulda been done in a different kinda way\nBut that ain't you, you play tough when you play\nIt's over now, I bet you still think about me\n\nI remember I held you so tight\nAnd we danced the night away\nWith the moves of two wide-eyed kids\nI need you so much today\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\n\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\n\nI remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet\nNo good for an old memory, to mean so much today\n\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\n\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\n\nWhen you close your eyes, do you dream about me\nWhen you go to sleep at night, do you dream about me"
