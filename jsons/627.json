    "lyrics": "Love You So LyricsMy darling, I love you so\nMore than you'll ever know\nEach night I kneel and say a prayer\nHoping when I wake you'll still be there\n\nI need your love with all my heart\nPromise me we'll never part\nWe have a love that's sure to be\nTrue love for all eternity\nAlways remember my love is true\n\nNo matter what I may do\nAnd stay in this heart of mine\nUntil the very end of time\nMy dearest, I beg of you\nTo keep this love so plain and true\nI ask the Lord, Lord up above\nTo never take away our love\nNo matter what I may do\nRemember my love is true\nWe have a love that's sure to be\nTrue love for all eternityEmbed"
