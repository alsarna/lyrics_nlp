    "lyrics": "Sweet Inspiration LyricsI need your sweet inspiration\nI need you here on my mind every hour of the day\nWithout your sweet inspiration\nThe lonely hours of the night just don't go my way\n\nA woman in love needs sweet inspiration\nAnd honey that's all I ask, you know, that's all I ask from you\nI gotta have your sweet inspiration\nYou know there's just ain't no telling what a satisfied woman might do\n\nWhen you call me, baby, baby\nIt's such a sweet inspiration\nThe way you call me darlin', darlin', darlin'\nSets my heart to skating\nAnd if I'm out in the rain, baby\nAnd in a bad situation\nYou know I just reach back in my mind\nAnd then I find your sweet inspiration\nSweet inspiration oh what a power\nAnd I've got the power every hour of the day\nI need your sweet inspiration, yeah\nTo go on livin' to keep on givin' this way\n\nSweet, sweet inspiration\nSweet, sweet inspirationEmbed"
