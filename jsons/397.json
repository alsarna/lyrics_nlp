    "lyrics": "Heavenly shades of night are falling\nIt's twilight time\nOut of the mist your voice is calling\n'Tis twilight time\nWhen purple colored curtains\nMark the end of day\nI'll hear you my dear at twilight time\n\nDeepening shadows gather splendor\nAs day is done\nFingers of night will soon surrender\nThe setting sun\nI count the moments darling\n'Till you're here with me\nTogether at last at twilight time\n\nHere in the afterglow of day\nWe keep our rendezvous beneath the blue\nHere in the sweet and same old way\nI fall in love again as I did then\n\nDeep in the dark your kiss will thrill me\nLike days of old\nLighting the spark of love that fills me\nWith dreams untold\nEach day I pray for evening just\nTo be with you\nTogether at last at twilight time\nHere in the afterglow of day\nWe keep our rendezvous beneath the blue\nHere in the sweet and same old way\nI fall in love again as I did then\n\nDeep in the dark your kiss will thrill me\nLike days of old\nLighting the spark of love that fills me\nWith dreams untold\n\nEach day I pray for evening just\nTo be with you\nTogether at last at twilight time\nTogether at last at twilight time"
