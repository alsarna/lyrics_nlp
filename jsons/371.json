Roach]\n\n[Verse: SciryL, !LLumiN@TE, and ManKind]\nI ain’t never watched Game of Thrones, but I was born\nIn the Year of the Dragon, yeah, smoking Dragon’s Breath\nSpitting fire—that’s a dragon’s breath\nGet that gasoline-match effect, game, match, and set\nBattle on set, the son of Apollo Creed\nGot his face leaking, he see his ricotta cheese\nThe sauce is Boss, George Steinbrenner, fire-bender.  Yeah!\nFire sign, that’s where I entеr\nSodom and Gomorrah idolized [?]\nGod Complex [?] symptoms, sodomized\nAbnеr Louima, unholy overseers\nJagged edges of pocket knives, monetized violence\nBomb it, watch the profit/prophet rise.  Uh!\nDollar signs, itemized budgets\nThree Musketeers with a musket, OkCupid\nPlay stupid, shells hit your bicuspid, have your momma\nCrying tears in a bucket.  Where’s the republic?\nThe Republican Party is getting gutted\nIt’s fucked up, but you gotta love it.  Iron Man\nSpider-Man versus Miss Muffet\nNuclear for the budget, right?  New fears\nFor the public, Cold War—heard winter is coming\nI ain’t seent it.  Cyclops trying to ride\nThe Phoenix, Wolverine pulling strings\nPuppets fall to the floor.  If it ain’t Civil, just call it a War\nPlanes hit you fake-issue brain tissue, blaze\nCrystal meth clinic, vampire, Blade’s pistol\nSilver bullet, pull it—huh!—erase the issue, yeah\nSlug hit you, blood trickle, scud missile\nPitch and catch a case if the glove fits you\nPo-po’ll still fuck with you like an ex that’s mad\nShe’s still in love with you, busting shots from your\nLove pistol—uh!  For Pistol Pete’s sake, no\nFoundation on a beat face—how you Kiss and make up?\nWake up, hear the cock-a-doodle-doos at\nThe crack of dawn, hop into your shoes—it’s the Lord’s Day\nAll day, every day, nigga, always\nCoca-Cola, ManKind co-controllers\nTwo players, soothsayers, Ying Yang Twins\nTwin shooters, double-barrel twin Rugers\nBarrel smoking like it’s [?] buddha\nTrying to find Nirvana, “Smelling Like Teen Spirit”\nIt’s just marijuana, magic-wand-waving\nHarry Potter.  On my Harry Belafonte\nSinging, “Mama, Look, A Boo Boo.”  For Chaka Khan, I’m Shaka Zulu\nWith the chakra voodoo, I ain’t watching Hulu\nI got hula-hoop dreams to be a guru\nYou need the juice and you need the juju to be a Double Dragon\nMotherfuck a casket.  We don’t die\nWe multiply, Bébé’s Kids disrupting traffic\nPuffing grass, Puff the Magic Dragon\nBlunted raps, Double Dragon packing, busting at your cabbage\nBen Savage, Boy Meets Girl in a World blindly\nLensCrafters, Sanskrit the pen, handcrafted the gems\nCracking the glass like Darryl Dawkins jamming at the rim\nNBA Jams, dabbing while I spin, then I\n“Slam” it—do your Googles.  Onyx, Fredro\nAnd Charlemagne shooting hoops, loose screw\nLudacris, buddha “Move Bitch,” Timberlands booted, re-\n-booted, Buu Saga, Goku sipping Goldschläger\nIn a low-rider, Ghost-Riding—huh!  Most High\nShould know the second that you gotta go, vamonos\n¡Adiós!  Fucking classic, what can match this?\nHuh!  Double DragonsEmbed"
