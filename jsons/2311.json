    "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\nTime was drifting\nThis rocker got to roll\nSo I hit the road and made my getaway\nRestless feeling, really got a hold\nI started searching for a better way\n\nBut I kept on looking for a sign\nIn the middle of the night\nBut I couldn't see the light\nNo, I couldn't see the light\nI kept on looking for a way\nTo take me through the night\nI couldn't get it right\nI couldn't get it right\n\nLA fever made me feel alright\nBut I must admit it got the best of me\nGetting down, so deep I could have drowned\nNow, I can't get back the way I used to be\n\nBut I kept on looking for a sign\nIn the middle of the night\nBut I couldn't see the light\nNo, I couldn't see the light\nI kept on looking for a way\nTo take me through the night\nI couldn't get it right\nI couldn't get it right\n[Bridge]\nNew York City took me with the tide\nAnd I nearly died from hospitality\nLeft me stranded, took away my pride\nJust another no account fatality\n\nBut I kept on looking for a sign\nIn the middle of the night\nBut I couldn't see the light\nNo, I couldn't see the light\nI kept on looking for a way\nTo take me through the night\nI couldn't get it right\nI couldn't get it right"
