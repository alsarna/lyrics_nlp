    "lyrics": "You Decorated My Life LyricsAll my life was a paper once plain, pure and white\nTill you moved with your pen changing moods now and then\nTill the balance was right\nThen you added some music, every note was in place\nAnd anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face\n\nAnd you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part\nAnd you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart\nYou decorated my life\n\nLike a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song\nThere was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along\nAnd you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise\nNow I'm able to see all the things life can be shining soft in your eyes\n\nAnd you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part\nAnd you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart\nYou decorated my lifeEmbed"
