    "lyrics": "Stand By Me LyricsWhen the night has come\nAnd our land is dark\nAnd the moon is the only light we'll see\nNo I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid\nJust as long, just as long as you stand by me\n\nDarlin', stand by me\nWon't you stand by me\nYou'll be needed, to stand by me\n\nAnd if the sky we look upon\nShould tumble and fall\nAnd the mountains should fall to the sea\nNo I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid\nJust as long, just as long as you stand by me\nDarlin', stand by me\nWon't you stand by me\nYou'll be needed, stand by me\n\nDarlin', stand by me\nWon't you stand by me\nYou'll be needed, stand by me\n\nDarlin', stand by me\nWon't you stand by me\nYou'll be needed, stand, stand by me...Embed"
