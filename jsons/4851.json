Got you hot\nNot too many bitches like her, one of a kind\nI mean even the bitches like her, she just a dime\nNot impressed by your Cris' poppin' 'cause if you would\nI might end, of the night we gone be lip locking\nBut only if I choose to, I don't fall in love easily\nGive you the blues Boo, I have you sittin'\n'Round misty-eyed Caramel, get 'em all the time\nHot shit from City High\n[Chorus: Claudette (Ryan)]\nAnywhere I go I'm spotted\n(Fo' real and that's no question)\nAnd anything I want I got it\n(No frontin' and no guessin')\n5' 5\" with brown eyes\n(Caramel complexion)\nSmile like the sunrise\n(Body like heaven)\n\n'Cause anywhere I go I'm spotted\n(Fo' real and that's no question)\nAnd anything I want I got it\n(No frontin' and no guessin')\n5' 5\" with brown eyes\n(Caramel complexion)\nSmile like the sunrise\n(Body like heaven)"
