    "lyrics": "Modern Girl LyricsHe wakes and says hello, turns on the breakfast show\nShe fixes coffee while he takes a shower\nHey that was great, he said, I wish we could stay in bed\nBut I got to be at work in less than an hour\nShe manages a smile as he walks out the door\nShe's a modern girl who's been though this movie before\n\nChorus:\nShe don't build her world 'round no single man\nBut she's gettin' by, doin' what she can\nShe is free to be, what she wants to be\n'N all what she wants to be, is a modern girl\nNa na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na, she's a modern girl\n\nIt looks like rain again, she takes a train again\nShe's on her way again through London town\nWhere she keeps a tangerine, flicks through a magazine\nUntil it's time to leave her dreams on the underground\nShe walks to the office like everyone else\nAn independent lady, takin' care of herself\nChorus\n\nShe's been dreaming 'bout it all day long\nAs soon as she gets home, it's him on the telephone\nHe asks her to dinner, she says I'm not free\nTonight I'm going to stay at home and watch my TV\n\nI don't build my world 'round no single man\nBut I'm gettin' by, doin' what I can\nI am free to be, what I want to be\n'N all what I want to be, is a modern girl\n\nNa na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na, she's a modern girl\nNa na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na, she's a modern girl\n(repeats out)Embed"
