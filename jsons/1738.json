    "lyrics": "I remember to this day\nThe bright red Georgia clay\nAnd how it stuck to the tires\nAfter the summer rain\nWill power made that old car go\nA woman's mind told me that so\nOh how I wish\nWe were back on the road again\n\nMe and you and a dog named Boo\nTravelling and living off the land\nMe and you and a dog named Boo\nHow I love being a free man\n\nI can still recall\nThe wheat fields of St. Paul\nAnd the morning we got caught\nRobbing from an old hen\nOld McDonald he made us work\nBut then he paid us for what it was worth\nAnother tank of gas\nAnd back on the road again\n\nMe and you and a dog named Boo\nTravelling and living off the land\nMe and you and a dog named Boo\nHow I love being a free man\nI'll never forget the day\nWe motored stately into big L.A\nThe lights of the city put settling\nDown in my brain\nThough it's only been a month or so\nThat old car's bugging us to go\nWe've gotta get away and get back on\nThe road again\n\nMe and you and a dog named Boo\nTravelling and living off the land\nMe and you and a dog named Boo\nHow I love being a free man"
