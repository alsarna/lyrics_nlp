Kelly]\nListen, girl, you want me but he needs you\nYet you're telling me that everything is cool\nTrying to convince me, baby, to do as you say\nJust go along and see things your way\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]\nAnd keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\nWe can keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\n\n[Verse 2: R. Kelly]\nSecret lovers is what you wanna be\nWhile making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me\nWhat is a man to do in a situation like this?\nI feel there is something that I, I don't wanna miss\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]\nAnd keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\nWe can keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\n\n[Verse 3: R. Kelly]\nBeautiful you are but you're his by far\nComing by my way driving his fancy car\nMaking plans to be in my life forever\nTell me, tell me that we'll always be together\n[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]\nAnd keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\nWe can keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\n\n[Outro: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]\nListen, babe, I won't whisper a word\nHow could you go, so low, so low\nNobody, nobody, nobody\nKeep it on the down low"
