    "lyrics": "Things LyricsEvery night\nI sit here by my window (Window)\nStaring at the lonely avenue (Avenue)\nWatching lovers holding hands and laughing (Laughing)\nAnd thinking bout the things we used to do\n\n(Thinking of things)\nLike a walk in the park (Things)\nLike a kiss in the dark (Things\nLike a sailboat ride (Yeah yeah)\nWhat about the night we cried\nThings like a lovers vow\nThings that we don't do now\nThinking bout the things we used to do\n\nMemories are all I have to cling to (Cling to)\nAnd heartaches are the friends I'm talking to (Talking to)\nWhen I'm not thinking of just how much I loved you\nWell I'm thinking about the things we used to do\n(Thinking of things)\nLike a walk in the park (Things)\nLike a kiss in the dark (Things)\nLike a sailboat ride (Yeah yeah)\nWhat about the night we cried\nThings like a lovers vow\nThings that we don't do now\nThinking bout the things we used to do\n\nI still can hear the jukebox softly playing (Playing)\nAnd the face I see each day belongs to you (Belong to you)\nThough there's not a single sound\nAnd theres nobody else around\nWell it's just me thinking of the things we used to do\n\n(Thinking of things)\nLike a walk in the park (Things)\nLike a kiss in the dark (Things)\nLike a sailboat ride (Yeah yeah)\nWhat about the night we cried\nThings like a lovers vow\nThings that we don't do now\nThinking bout the things we used to do\n\nAnd the heartaches are the friends I'm talking to\nYou got me thinking bout the things we used to doEmbed"
