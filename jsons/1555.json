    "lyrics": "You really should accept\nThis time he's gone for good\nHe'll never come back now\nEven though he said he would\nSo darling dry your eyes\nSo many other guys\nWould give the world I'm sure\nTo wear the shoes he wore\n\nOh, c'mon\nSmile a little smile for me, Rosemarie\nWhere's the use in cryin'?\nIn a little while you'll see, Rosemarie\nYou must keep on tryin'\n\nI know that he hurt you bad\nI know darling don't be sad and\nSmile a little smile for me, Rosemarie, Rosemarie\n\nI guess you're lonely now\nLove's comin' to an end\nBut darling only now\nAre you free to start again\nLift up your pretty chin\nDon't let those tears begin\nYou're a big girl now\nAnd you'll pull through somehow\nOh, c'mon\nSmile a little smile for me, Rosemarie\nWhere's the use in cryin'?\nIn a little while you'll see, Rosemarie\nYou must keep on tryin'\n\nI know that he hurt you bad\nI know darling don't be sad and\nSmile a little smile for me, Rosemarie, Rosemarie\n\nBah bah bah bah bah bah\nBah bah bah\nBah bah\nBah bah bah bah\n\nSmile a little smile for me, Rosemarie, Rosemarie"
