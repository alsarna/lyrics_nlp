    "lyrics": "Since I met you baby my whole life has changed\nSince I met you baby my whole life has changed\nAnd everybody tells me that I am not the same\n\nI don't need nobody to tell my troubles to\nI don't need nobody to tell my troubles to\nCause since I met you baby all I need is you\n\nSince I met you baby I'm a happy man\nSince I met you baby I'm a happy man\nI'm gonna try to please you in every way I can"
