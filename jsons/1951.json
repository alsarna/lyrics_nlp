    "lyrics": "Clair, the moment I met you, I swear\nI felt as if something, somewhere\nHad happened to me, which I couldn't see\nAnd then, the moment I met you, again\nI knew in my heart that we were friends\nIt had to be so, it couldn't be, No\n\nBut try as hard as I might do, I don't know why\nYou get to me in a way I can't describe\nWords mean so little when you look up and smile\nI don't care what people say\nTo me you're more than a child\n\nOh, Clair\nClair\n\nClair, if ever a moment so rare\nWas captured for all to compare\nThat moment is you in all that you do\nBut why in spite of our age difference do I cry\nEach time I leave you I feel I could die\nNothing means more to me than hearing you say\n\"I'm going to marry you\nWill you marry me, Uncle Ray\"\n\nOh, Clair\nClair\nClair, I've told you before \"Don't you dare\"\n\"Get back into bed\"\n\"Can't you see that it's late\"\n\"No you can't have a drink\"\n\"Oh, alright then, but wait just a minute\"\n\nWhile I, in an effort to babysit, catch up my breath\nWhat there is left of it\nYou can be murder at this hour of the day\nBut in the morning this hour will seem a lifetime away\nOh Clair\nClair\nOh Clair"
