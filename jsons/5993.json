(Woo)\nFor thinkin' that we could be something for real?\nNow, am I wrong?\nFor tryin' to reach the things that I can't see?\nBut that's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel\nTrying to reach the things that I can't see (Ooh, ooh)\n[Verse 2: Nico]\nAm I trippin' for having a vision?\nMy prediction, I'ma be on top of the world\nWalk your walk and don't look back\nAlways do what you decide\nDon't let them control your life\nThat's just how I feel, oh-ooh-woah\nFight for yours, and don't let go\nDon't let them compare you, no\nDon't worry, you're not alone\nThat's just how we feel\n\n[Chorus: Vinz]\nAm I wrong? (Am I wrong?)\nFor thinkin' that we could be something for real?\n(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)\nNow, am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)\nFor tryin' to reach the things that I can't see?\n(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nBut that's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel\nTrying to reach the things that I can't see (Ooh, ooh)\n\n[Bridge: Nico]\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong\nI don't wanna be right, right\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong\nI don't wanna be right\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong (Now, if you tell me I'm wrong)\nI don't wanna be right, right\nIf you tell me I'm wrong, wrong\nI don't wanna be right\n[Chorus: Vinz]\nAm I wrong?\nFor thinkin' that we could be something for real?\nNow, am I wrong?\nFor tryin' to reach the things that I can't see?\nBut that's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel\nTrying to reach the things that I can't see (Ooh, ooh)\nSo, am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)\nFor thinkin' that we could be something for real?\n(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)\nNow, am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)\nFor trying to reach the things that I can't see?\n(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nBut that's just how I feel  (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel  (Ooh, ooh)\nThat's just how I feel\nTrying to reach the things that I can't see (Ooh, ooh)\n\n[Outro]\nWoah215Embed"
