    "lyrics": "On the isle of Filalilla out Hawai way\nA hula maiden gay strolled by a monlit bay\nThere come a to court her over the water\nFrom a savage Zingazulu land\nA Bolo chieftain grand sang her this lay\n\nAnd he sang\nHulu Hawai hula\nSmile on your zing gang a zula\nMoon shine above\nOn your sweet jungle love\nFor you my bolo is swinging\nFor you my love song I'm singing\nCome be my Hula Hula love\n\nBut the chieftain from the peaceful Filalilla land\nWould not give him her hand\nHer lover took his stand\nThrough the rattle of the battle\nAs she heard his sweet voice calm and true\nThey fled in his canoe over water blue\n\nAnd he sang\nHulu Hawai hula\nSmile on your zing gang a zula\nMoon shine above\nOn your sweet jungle love\nFor you my bolo is swinging\nFor you my love song I'm singing\nCome be my Hula Hula love"
