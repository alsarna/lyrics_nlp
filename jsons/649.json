    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe used to have good times together\nBut now I feel them slip away\nIt makes me cry to see love die\nSo sad to watch good love go bad\n\n[Verse 2]\nRemember how you used to feel, dear?\nYou said nothing could change your mind\nIt breaks my heart, to see us part\nSo sad to watch good love go bad\n\n[Bridge]\nIs it any wonder that I feel so blue\nWhen I know for certain that I'm losing you\n\n[Verse 2]\nRemember how you used to feel, dear?\nYou said nothing could change your mind\nIt breaks my heart, to see us part\nSo sad to watch good love go bad\n\n[Outro]\nSo sad to watch good love go bad"
