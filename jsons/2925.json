    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI walk along the city streets, you used to walk along with me\nAnd every step I take reminds me of just how we used to be\nOh, how can I forget you, girl, when there is\nAlways something there to remind me\nAlways something there to remind me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen shadows fall, I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night\nAnd I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight\nOh, how can I forget you, girl, when there is\nAlways something there to remind me\nAlways something there to remind me\n\n[Chorus]\nI was born to love her and I will never be free\nYou'll always be a part of me [oh woh oh]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share\nJust go back to the places where we used to go and I'll be there\nOh, how can I forget you, girl, when there is\nAlways something there to remind me\nAlways something there to remind me\n\n[Chorus]\nI was born to love her and I will never be free\nYou'll always be a part of me 'cause there is\nAlways something there to remind me\nAlways something there to remind me\n[Chorus]\nAlways something there to remind me\nAlways something there to remind me\nAlways something there to remind me"
