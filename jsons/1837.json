(Where is all your love?)\nWhere is the love?\n\n[Verse 1: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]\nWhere is the love\nYou said you'd give to me soon as you were free?\nWill it ever be?\nWhere is the love?\n\n[Refrain: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]\nYou told me that you didn't love him\nAnd you were gonna say goodbye\nBut if you really didn't mean it\nWhy did you have to lie?\n[Verse 2: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]\nWhere is the love\nYou said was mine all mine, 'til the end of time?\nWas it just a lie?\nWhere is the love?\n\n[Refrain: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]\nIf you had had a sudden change of heart\nI wish that you would tell me so\nDon't leave me hangin' on the promises\nYou've got to let me know\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, Donny Hathaway, Roberta Flack]\nOh, how I wish I never met you\nI guess it must have been my fate\nTo fall in love with someone else's love\nAll I can do is wait\nWait (That's all I can do, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Outro: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]\nWhere is the love? (Where is the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is all the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is all the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is the love?)\nWhere is the love? (Where is the love?)Embed"
