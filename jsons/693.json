    "lyrics": "This is dedicated to the one I love\nWhile I'm far away from you my baby\nI know it's hard for you my baby\nBecause it's hard for me my baby\nAnd the darkest hour is just before dawn\n\nEach night before you go to bed my baby\nWhisper a little prayer for me my baby\nAnd tell all the stars above\nThis is dedicated to the one I love\n\nLife can never be exactly like we want it to be\nI can be satisfied just knowing that you love me\nThere's one thing I want you to do especially for me\nAnd it's something that everybody needs\n\nEach night before you go to bed my baby\nWhisper a little prayer for me my baby\nAnd tell all the stars above\nThis is dedicated to the one I love\nThis is dedicated to the one I love"
