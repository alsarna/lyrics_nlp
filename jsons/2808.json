    "lyrics": "We walked the loneliest mile\nWe smiled without any style\nWe kiss altogether wrong\nNo intention\n\nWe lied about each other's drinks\nWe lived without each other thinking\nWhat anyone would do\nWithout me and you\n\nIt's like I told you\nOnly the lonely can play\n\nSo hold on, here we go\nHold on to nothing we know\nI feel so lonely\nWay up here\n\nYou mention the time we were together\nSo long ago\nWell, I don't remember\nAll I know is that it makes me feel good now\n\nIt's like I told you\nOnly the lonely can play\nOnly the lonely\nOnly the lonely can play\nOnly the lonely\nOnly the lonely can play\nIt's like I told you\nOnly the lonely can play\nOnly the lonely\nOnly the lonely can play"
