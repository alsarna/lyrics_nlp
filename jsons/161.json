    "lyrics": "Melody of Love LyricsWaltz tempo\nHold me in your arms, dear, dream with me\nCradled by your kisses, tenderly\nWhile a choir of angels from above\nSings our melody of love\n\nInstrumental break\nHeart to heart forever, lips entwined\nI am yours and you are mine, all mine\nHeaven wrote the music up above\nFor our melody of love\n\nMelody of loveEmbed"
