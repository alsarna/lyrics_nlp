Take it\nYou can have the best of me baby now\nAnd I will give you anything\nCan you feel this energy? Take it\nYou can have the best of me baby now\n\n[Post-Bridge]\nOh, turn the lights turn the lights down low\nYeah, now I'm feeling you breathing slow, oh\n[Chorus]\nOh, turn the lights, turn the lights down low\n(Turn the lights down low)\nYeah, now I'm feeling you breathing slow (low, low, low)\n'Cause, baby, we're just reckless kids\nTrying to find an island in the flood\nOh, turn the lights, turn the lights down low, oh\n\n[Outro]\nOh-oh-oh-ohh (Turn the lights down low)\nOh-oh-oh-ohh\nOh-oh-oh-ohh\nOh-oh-oh-ohh"
