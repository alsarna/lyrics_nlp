Should I fall?\nShould I do it after all?\nIs it crazy? Is it right?\nI really wanna love him tonight\nShould I do it? Should I play?\nCan I help it anyway?\nWhen I feel him hold me tight\nI'm gonna turn on like a light\n[Verse 2]\nI know when we're in his car\nI couldn't go just so far\nI wanna give him everything\nSo when I hear the telephone ring, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nShould I do it? Should I fall?\nShould I do it after all?\nIs it crazy? Is it right?\nI really wanna love him tonight\nShould I do it? Should I play?\nCan I help it anyway?\nWhen I feel him hold me tight\nI'm gonna turn on like a light\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, I'm so lonely, and he's so fine\nMaybe I should swallow my pride\nJust one, one, one more time, yeah\nOoh, uh-huh\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\n(I really got to know)\nShould I do it? Should I fall?\nShould I do it after all?\nIs it crazy? Is it right?\nI really wanna love him tonight\nShould I do it? Should I play?\nCan I help it anyway?\nWhen I feel him hold me tight\nI'm gonna turn on like a light\n[Outro]\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (Should I do it?)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (Oh, oh, should I do it?)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (Should I, should I walk away?)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (Oh, it's driving me crazy)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (Should I do it?)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (And you'll love him 'cause I do it)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (I really wanna love him)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (I don't know, should I do it?)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (I just don't know)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (I really, I really wanna love him)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (Driving me crazy)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (Yeah, it's driving me crazy)\nShould I do it? Should I do it? (I just don't know)\nShould I do it? Should I do it?Embed"
