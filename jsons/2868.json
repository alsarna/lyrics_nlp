    "lyrics": "I swore when he hurt me so, I wouldn't see him anymore\nBut today he called my name - oh, I could feel the same old flame\n\nShould I do it, should I fall? Should I do it after all oh?\nIs it crazy, is it right? I really wanna love him tonight\nShould I do it, should I play? Can I help it anyway?\nWhen I feel him hold me tight, I'm gonna turn on like a light\n\nI know when we're in his car, I couldn't go just so far\nI wanna give him everything\nSo, when I hear the telephone ring, yeah:\n\nShould I do it, should I fall?...\nOh, I'm so lonely and he's so fine\nMaybe I should swallow my pride\nJust one, one, one more time, yeah\n\nBaby, I've got to know: Should I do it, should I fall?..."
