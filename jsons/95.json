    "lyrics": "Till I waltz again with you\nLet no other hold your charms\nIf my dreams should all come true\nYou'll be waiting for my arms\n\nTill I kiss you once again\nKeep my love locked in your heart\nDarling I'll return and then\nWe will never have to part\n\nThough it may break your heart and mine\nThe minute when it's time to go\nRemember dear, each word divine\nThat meant I love you so\n\nTill I waltz again with you\nJust the way we are tonight\nI will keep my promise true\nFor you are my guiding light\n\nTill I waltz again with you\nKeep my love locked in your heart\nDarling I'll return and then\nWe will never have to part\n\nThough it may break your heart and mine\nThe minute when it's time to go\nRemember dear, each word divine\nThat meant I love you so\nTill I waltz again with you\nJust the way we are tonight\nI will keep my promise true\nFor you are my guiding light\n\nMy light, my light\nI will keep my promise true\nTill I waltz again with you"
