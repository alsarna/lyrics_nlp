    "lyrics": "Love (Can Make You Happy) LyricsWake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes\nAnd the smell of flowers blooming fills the air\nYour mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone - that you\nLove;\nYour life is filled with joy when she is there\n\nLove can make you happy if you fine someone who cares\nTo give a life time to you and who has a love to share\n\nIf you think you've found someone you'll love forevermore\nThen it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay)\nTo have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase\nThat means the love you've found is going to stay\n\nLove can make you happy if you find someone who cares\nTo give a life time to you and who has a love to share\nLa-love, la-love\n\nLove can make you happy\nLove can make you happy\nLove can make you happy\nLoveEmbed"
