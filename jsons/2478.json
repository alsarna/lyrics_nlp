    "lyrics": "{Intro}\nShe stood there bright as the sun on that California coast\nHe was a Midwestern boy on his own\nShe looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue\nHe knew right then he was too far from home\nHe was too far from home\n\nShe took his hand and she led him along that golden beach\nThey watched the waves tumble over the sand\nThey drove for miles and miles up those twisting, turning roads\nHigher and higher and higher they climbed\n\nAnd those Hollywood nights\nIn those Hollywood hills\nShe was looking so right\nIn her diamonds and frills\nOh those big city nights\nIn those high rolling hills\nAbove all the lights\nShe had all of her skills\n\n{Bridge}\n\nHe'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good\nSee some old friends, good for the soul\nShe had been born with a face that would let her get her way\nHe saw that face and he lost all control\nHe had lost all control\nNight after night, day after day, it went on and on\nThen came that morning he woke up alone\nHe spent all night staring down at the lights on LA\nWondering if he could ever go home\nAnd those Hollywood nights\nIn those Hollywood hills\nShe was looking so right\nIt was giving him chills\nIn those big city nights\nIn those high rolling hills\nAbove all the lights\nWith a passion that kills\n\nIn those Hollywood nights\nIn those Hollywood hills\nShe was looking so right\nIn her diamonds and frills\nOh those big city nights\nIn those high rolling hills\nAbove all the lights\nShe had all of her skills\n\nIn those Hollywood nights...."
