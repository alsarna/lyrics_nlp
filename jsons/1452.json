    "lyrics": "Why am I losing sleep over you?\nReliving precious moments we knew\n\nSo many days have gone by\nStill I'm so lonely and I\nGuess there's just no getting over you\nAnd there's nothing I can do\nBut spend all of my time out of my mind\nOver you\n\nWithin the prison walls of my mind\nThere's still a part of you left behind\nAnd though it hurts I'll get by\nWithout your loving yet I\nGuess there's just no getting over you\nAnd there's nothing I can do\nBut spend all of my time out of my mind\nOver you\n\nAnd I guess there's just no getting over you\nAnd there's nothing I can do\nBut spend all of my time out of my mind\nOver you\n\nAnd I guess there's just no getting over you\nAnd there's nothing I can do\nBut spend all of my time out of my mind"
