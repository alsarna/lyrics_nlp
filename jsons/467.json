    "lyrics": "Devoted to You LyricsDarlin' you can count on me\nTill the sun dries up the sea\nUntil then I'll always be devoted to you\n\nI'll be yours through endless time\nI'll adore your charms sublime\nGuess by now you know that I'm devoted to you\n\nI'll never hurt you, I'll never lie\nI'll never be untrue\nI'll never give you reason to cry\nI'd be unhappy if you were blue\n\nThrough the years my love will grow\nLike a river it will flow\nIt can't die because I'm so devoted to you\nI'll never hurt you, I'll never lie\nI'll never be untrue\nI'll never give you reason to cry\nI'd be unhappy if you were blue\n\nThrough the years my love will grow\nLike a river it will flow\nIt can't die because I'm so devoted to you1Embed"
