    "lyrics": "The Loveliest Night of the Year LyricsWhen you are in love\nIt's the loveliest night of the year\nStars twinkle above\nAnd you almost can touch them from here\n\nWords fall into rhyme\nAnytime you are holding me near\nWhen you are in love\nIt's the loveliest night of the year\n\nWaltzing along in the blue\nLike a breeze drifting over the sand\nThrilled by the wonder of you\nAnd the wonderful touch of your hand\n\nAnd my heart starts to beat\nLike a child when a birthday is near\nSo kiss me, my sweet\nIt's the loveliest night of the year\nWaltzing along in the blue\nLike a breeze drifting over the sand\nThrilled by the wonder of you\nAnd the wonderful touch of your hand\n\nAnd my heart starts to beat\nLike a child when a birthday is near\nSo kiss me, my sweet\nIt's the loveliest night of the yearEmbed"
