    "lyrics": "I can't stay, yes I know\nYou know I hate to go\nBut goodbye, love was sweet\nOur worlds can never meet\n\nSo I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you so\nAnd I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go\nAway\n\nCan't you see how I feel\nWhen I say love's unreal\nSo goodbye, it's been sweet\nEven though incomplete\n\nSo I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you so\nAnd I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go\nAway\n\nEvery night I still hear\nAll your sighs very clear\nNow love's gone, gone away\nAs I once heard you say\n\nNow I've cried just a little 'cause I loved you so\nAnd I've died just a little 'cause I had to go\nAway"
