Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame! Woo!) Now freeze!\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday\nZoom-lens feelings just won't disappear\nClose-up darkroom sweet-talk in my ear\nHer hot-spot love for me is strong\nThis freeze-frame moment can't be wrong\n\n[Chorus]\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame! Woo!) Now freeze!\n\n[Bridge]\n(Shoot, shoot)\n(Shoot, shoot)\n(Shoot, shoot)\n\n[Chorus]\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!\n(Freeze-Frame! Woo!) Now freeze!\n[Outro]\nYeah\nFreeze frame\nOh yeah\nFreeze frame\nFreeze frame\nFreeze frame\nFreeze frameEmbed"
