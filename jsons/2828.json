    "lyrics": "I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday\nSlow-motion weekdays stare me down\nHer lipstick reflex got me wound\nThere were no defects to be found\nSnapshot image froze without a sound\n\nThursday morning was a hot flash-factor\nHer face still focused in my mind\nTest-strip proof-sheet love is hard to find\nFriday night we'll dance the spotlight grind\nStop-time heart for me if she's not mine\n\nCHORUS:\nFreeze-Frame! (Freeze-Frame!) (REPEAT TWICE)\nFreeze-Frame! Now Freeze!\nNow I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday\nZoom lens feelings just won't disappear\nClose-up darkroom sweet-talk in my ear\nHer hot-spot love for me is strong\nThis freeze-frame moment can't be wrong\nCHORUS (repeat once)\nFreeze frame...\n\nFADE"
