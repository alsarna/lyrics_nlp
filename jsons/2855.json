    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?\nI found an empty garden among the flagstones there\nWho lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot\nWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop\nNow it all looks strange\nIt's funny how one insect can damage so much grain\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door\nAnd in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more\nWho lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot\nWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop\nAnd we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed\nA gardener like that one, no one can replace\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've been knockin', but no one answers\nAnd I've been knockin' most of the day\nOh, and I've been callin', \"oh, hey, hey, Johnny\nCan't you come out to play?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd through their tears\nSome say he farmed his best in younger years\nBut he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear\nWho lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot\nWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop\nNow we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls\nWe hear, we hear your name\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've been knockin', but no one answers\nAnd I've been knockin' most of the day\nOh, and I've been callin', \"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny\nCan't you come out to play?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've been knockin', but no one answers\nAnd I've been knockin' most of the day\nOh, and I've been callin', \"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny\nCan't you come out?\nCan you come out to play?\"\n\n[Outro]\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?"
