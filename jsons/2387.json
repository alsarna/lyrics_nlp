    "lyrics": "[Chorus:]\nLove is higher than a mountain\nLove is thicker than water\nYou are this dreamer's only dream\nHeaven's angel, devil's daughter\n\n[Verse 1:]\nSay, my mind\nShould I go with her on silent nights\nShe'll drive me crazy in the end\nAnd I should leave this paradise\n\nBut I can't leave her\nWhile I need her more\nThan she needs you\nThat's what I'm living for\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nSay, my thought\nShould I find out she don't care at all\nShe'll leave me crying in the end\nWandering through the afterglow\n\nBut I can't leave her\nWhile I need her more\nThan she needs you\nThat's what I'm praying for\n[Repeat Chorus x2:]\n\nLa, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la..."
