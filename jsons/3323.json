Didn't I treat you right?\nYou made me feel so good, made me feel myself\nNow I'm alone and you're with somebody else\nThis is the night, this is the night\nThis is the time we've got to get it right (this is the night)\n[Chorus]\nTouch me, touch me I wanna feel your body\nYour heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)\nTouch me, touch me now\nTouch me, touch me now\nTouch me, touch me now\n\n[Bridge]\nHot and cold emotion, confusing my brain\nI could not decide, between pleasure and pain\nLike a tramp in the night, I was begging for you\nTo treat my body like you wanted to\nOh, I was begging for you (this is the night)\n\n[Chorus]\nTouch me, touch me I wanna feel your body\nYour heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)\n'Cause I want your body all the time (this is the night)\nTouch me, touch me I wanna feel your body\nYour heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)\n'Cause I want your body all the time\nTouch me, touch me, touch me (this is the night)\nTouch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body\nTouch me, touch me, touch me (this is the night)\nTouch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body\nTouch me, touch me, touch me (this is the night)"
