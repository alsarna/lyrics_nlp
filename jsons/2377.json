    "lyrics": "How much love do you need\nBefore you give your love to me\nHow much time before it grows\nHow much love I wanna know\n\nWhat can I do what can I say\nThe last thing I want is to drive you away\nHow much love does it take\nHow much love for heaven sake\n\nHow much love how much love\nDo I rush right in or do I hesitate\nHow much love how much love how much love\n\nAm I tryin' too hard\nGive me some kind of clue\nThere must be a way to get through to you\nShould I come on strong or do I hesitate\nDo I rush right in or do I wait\n\nHow much love how much love\nDo I rush right in or do I hesitate\nHow much love how much love how much love\n\nI got so much love\nDon't know where to begin\nI'm pleadin' with you babe\nYou gotta let me in"
