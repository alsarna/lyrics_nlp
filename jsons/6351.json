What if I mess you up?\"\nYou say, \"What if I break your heart in two, then what?\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]\nWell, I hear you, girl, I feel you, girl, but not so fast\nBefore you make your mind up, I gotta ask\n\n[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]\nWhat if I was made for you and you were made for me?\nWhat if this is it? What if it's meant to be?\nWhat if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?\nWhat if I just pull you close? What if I lean in\nAnd the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?\nWhat if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?\nWhat if I loved all these what ifs away?\n[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]\nWhat if the sky falls (Sky falls)\nOr the sun stops burnin'?\nWe could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'\nOr I could kiss you (You should kiss me)\nWhat if you liked it? (Bet I'd like it)\nWell, we ain't never gonna know unless we try it\n\n[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina, Kane Brown]\nWhat if I was made for you and you were made for me?\nWhat if this is it? What if it's meant to be?\nWhat if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?\nWhat if I just pull you close? What if I lean in\nAnd the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?\nWhat if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?\nWhat if I loved all these what ifs away?\nAw, yeah\nCome on\n\n[Bridge: Kane Brown]\nYou say, \"What if I hurt you? What if I leave you?\nWhat if I find somebody else and I don't need you?\"\nDamn\n\n[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]\nWhat if I was made for you and you were made for me?\nWhat if this is it? What if it's meant to be?\nWhat if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?\nYeah, what if I just pull you close? What if I lean in\nAnd the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?\nWhat if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?\nWhat if I loved all these what ifs away?\n[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]\nAway (Away)\nWhat if?21Embed"
