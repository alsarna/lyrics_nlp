I found the vein, put it in here\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI live for the applause, applause, applause\nI live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause\nLive for the way that you cheer and scream for me\nThe applause, applause, applause\n\n[Chorus]\nGive me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)\nGive me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)\n[Post-Chorus]\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've overheard your theory, \"Nostalgia's for geeks\"\nI guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read\nOne second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me\nPop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI live for the applause, applause, applause\nI live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause\nLive for the way that you cheer and scream for me\nThe applause, applause, applause\n\n[Chorus]\nGive me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)\nGive me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)\n[Post-Chorus]\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch\n\n[Bridge]\nWoo... touch, touch\nWoo... touch, touch\nNow... woo-oh-oh-oh...\nWoo-oh-oh-oh...\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI live for the applause, applause, applause\nI live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause\nLive for the way that you cheer and scream for me\nThe applause, applause, applause\n\n[Chorus]\nGive me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)\nGive me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)\n[Post-Chorus]\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)\nA-P-P-L-A-U-S-E\nPut your hands up, make 'em touch, touch\n\n[Outro]\nA-R-T-P-O-P82Embed"
