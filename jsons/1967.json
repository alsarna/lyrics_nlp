Tell me just how\nI can satisfy you woman, you're drivin' me wild\n\nBreak up to make up, that's all we do\nFirst you love me then you hate me\nThat's a game for fools\nBreak up to make up that's all we do\nFirst you love me then you hate me\nThat's a game for fools\n\nWhen I come home from workin', you're on the phone\nTalkin' about how bad I treat you, now tell me I'm wrong\nYou say it's me who argues, I'll say it's you\nWe have got to get together or baby, we're through\nBreak up to make up, that's all we do\nFirst you love me then you hate me\nThat's a game for fools\nBreak up to make up, that's all we do\nYeah, first you love me then you hate me\nThat's a game for fools\n\nBreak up to make up, that's all we do\nYeah, first you love me then you hate me\nThat's a game for fools\n\nBreak up to make up, that's all we do\nFirst you love me then you hate me\nThat's a game for foolsEmbed"
