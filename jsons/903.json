    "lyrics": "Walk like a man\n\nOh, how you tried to cut me down to size\nTellin' dirty lies to my friends\nBut my own father said \"Give her up, don't bother\nThe world isn't comin' to an end\"\n(He said)\n\nWalk like a man, talk like a man\nWalk like a man my son\nNo woman's worth crawlin' on the earth\nSo walk like a man, my son\n\nBye bye baby, I don't-a mean maybe\nGonna get along somehow\nSoon you'll be cryin' on account of all your lyin'\nOh yeah, just look who's laughin' now\n(I'm gonna)\n\nWalk like a man, fast as I can\nWalk like a man from you\nI'll tell the world \"forget about it, girl\"\nAnd walk like a man from you"
