    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI love little baby ducks, old pick-up trucks\nSlow movin' trains and rain\nI love little country streams, sleep without dreams\nSunday school in May and hay\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love you too\n\n[Verse 2]\nI love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends\nBirds of the world and squirrels\nI love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups\nBourbon in a glass and grass\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love you too\n\n[Verse 3]\nI love honest open smiles, kisses from a child\nTomatoes on the vine and onions\nI love winners when they cry, losers when they try\nMusic when it's good and life\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love you too"
