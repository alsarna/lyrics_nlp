    "lyrics": "Year of the Cat Lyrics{Instrumental Lead In}\nOn a morning from a Bogart movie\nIn a country where they turn back time\nYou go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre\nContemplating a crime\nShe comes out of the sun in a silk dress running\nLike a watercolor in the rain\nDon't bother asking for explanations\nShe'll just tell you that she came\nIn the Year of the Cat\n\nShe doesn't give you time for questions\nAs she locks up your arm in hers\nAnd you follow 'till your sense of which direction\nCompletely disappears\nBy the blue tiled walls near the market stalls\nThere's a hidden door she leads you to\nThese days, she says, I feel my life\nJust like a river running through\nThe Year of the Cat\nWell She looks at you so coolly\nAnd her eyes shine like the moon in the sea\nShe comes in Incense and Patchouli\nSo you take her, to find what's waiting inside\nThe Year of the Cat\n{Instrumental Bridge}\nWell morning comes and you're still with her\nAnd the bus and the tourists are gone\nAnd you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket\nSo you have to stay on\nBut the drum-beat strains of the night remain\nIn the rhythm of the new-born day\nYou know sometime you're bound to leave her\nBut for now you're going to stay\nIn the Year of the Cat\n{Outro}13Embed"
