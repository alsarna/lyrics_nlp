Let me know\nGirl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow\nYou just put your lips together and you come real close\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook, I'm bettin' you like people\nAnd I'm bettin' you love freak mode\nAnd I'm bettin' you like girls\nThat give love to girls and stroke your little ego\nI bet you I'm guilty, your honor (Honor)\nThat's just how we live in my genre (Genre)\nWho in the hell done paved the road wider?\nThere's only one Flo and one Rida\nI'm a damn shame, order more champagne\nPulling them hamstrings, tryna put it on ya\nBet your lips spin back around corner\nSlow it down, baby, take a little longer\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby?
