    "lyrics": "Wild kind of look to the day\nOpening eyes impale neon flickers\nShe moon, she turning away\nThe city's her slave but he's cheating his mistress\n\nShe's moody and grey\nShe's mean and she's restless\nSo restless, so restless indeed\n\nAll over you as they say\nRumours or rivals yell at the strike force\nHi guys, by the way\nAre you aware you're being illegal?\n\nIt's making your savior behaviour look evil\n'Scuse my timing but say\nHow'd you fit in with this flim, flam and judy\n\nMaximum big surprise\nYour smile is something new\n\nI pull my shirt off and pray\nWe're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave\nPull my shirt off and pray\nWe're coming up on re-election day\nStretching my love down the way\nTo your invitation stretching my body\nUse your intuitive play\n'Cause maybe we have more play time than money\n\nMaximum big surprise\nShe knows something new\n\nI pull my shirt off and pray\nI'm saving myself to suffer the heatwave\nPull my shirt off and pray\nWe're coming up on re-election day\n\nBy roads and backways a lover's chance down wind\nCut open murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin\nCarry further, entangled strands all sing\nI'm saving some time to slip away\nWe could dance!\n\nShouldn't be asking, wild and scheming\nCould be my election day\n\nMaximum big surprise\nYou know something new\n\nI pull my shirt off and pray\nWe're sacred and bound to suffer this heatwave\nPull my shirt off and pray\nWe're coming up on re-election day\nRe-election day"
