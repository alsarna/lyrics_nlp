Your demons\nAnd all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?\nBecause one day, I'll leave you a phantom\nTo lead you in the summer to join the black parade...\"\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Refrain]\nWhen I was a young boy, my father\nTook me into the city to see a marching band\nHe said, \"Son, when you grow up would you be\nThe savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?\"\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me\nAnd other times I feel like I should go\nAnd through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets\nAnd when you're gone, we want you all to know\n[Chorus]\nWe'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're\nDead and gone, believe me, your memory\nWill carry on, we'll carry on, and in my\nHeart, I can't contain it, the anthem won't explain it\n\n[Verse 2]\nA world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams\nYour misery and hate will kill us all\nSo paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear\nDefiant to the end we hear the call\n\n[Chorus]\nTo carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're\nDead and gone, believe me, your memory\nWill carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're\nBroken and defeated, your weary widow marches\n\n[Bridge]\nOn and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)\nDisappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)\nTake a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDo or die, you'll never make me\nBecause the world will never take my heart\nGo and try, you'll never break me\nWe want it all, we wanna play this part\nI won't explain or say I'm sorry\nI'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars\nGive a cheer for all the broken\nListen here, because it's who we are\nI'm just a man, I'm not a hero\nJust a boy, who had to sing this song\nI'm just a man, I'm not a hero\nI don't care!\n[Chorus]\nWe'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're\nDead and gone, believe me, your memory\nWill carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're\nBroken and defeated, your weary widow marches\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDo or die, you'll never make me\nBecause the world will never take my heart\nGo and try, you'll never break me\nWe want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on!)\nDo or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on!)\nBecause the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on!)\nGo and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry-)\nWe want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on...)\n\n[Drum Outro]"
