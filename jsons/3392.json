    "lyrics": "Anything for you\nThough you're not here\nSince you said we're through\nIt seems like years\nTime keeps dragging on and on\nAnd forever's been and gone\nStill I can't figure what went wrong\n\nI'd still do anything for you\nI'll play your game\nYou hurt me through and through\nBut you can have your way\n\nI can pretend each time I see you\nThat I don't care\nAnd I don't need you\nAnd though you'll never see me crying\nYou know inside I feel like dying\n\nAnd I'd do anything for you\nIn spite of it all\nI've learned so much from you\nYou made me strong\n\nBut don't you ever think that\nI don't love you\nThat for one minute\nI forgot you\nBut sometimes things don't work out right\nAnd you just have to say goodbye\nI hope you find someone to please you\nSomeone who'll care and never leave you\nBut if that someone ever hurts you\nYou just might need a friend to turn to\n\nAnd I'd do anything for you\nI'll give you up\nIf that's what I should do\nTo make you happy\n\nI can pretend each time I see you\nThat I don't care\nAnd I don't need you\nAnd though inside I feel like dying\nYou know you'll never see me crying\n\nDon't you ever think that\nI don't love you\nThat for one minute I forgot you\nBut sometimes things don't work out right\nAnd you just have to say goodbye"
