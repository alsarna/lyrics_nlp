    "lyrics": "That a man can have a good woman\nThat he can call his very own\nA woman who will stay right there at home\nAnd mind the children while he's gone to work\nA woman who will have his dinner cooked\nWhen he comes home\nWhere some men make mistakes is\nWhen they go out and stay because they feel\nNo other wants his woman but him\nWell listen, if you think no other man wants her\nJust throw her away and you will see\nSome men will have her before you can count 1, 2, 3\nYes he will, yes he will\n\nListen girls, this goes for you too\nBecause you know I've seen so man women\nWho've had so many good men in life\nMen who would stand by them thru thick and thin\nMen who'd go to work everyday and\nBring home their hard earned pay\nMen who'd give their woman anything\nTheir little hearts desired\nWhere some women make mistakes is\nWhen their men go out and let em play they would stay\nBecause they felt that no other woman wanted him but her\nWell listen, if you think no other woman wants him\nJust pitch him out in the street and you will see\nSome woman will have your man\nBefore you can count 1, 2, 3\nYes she will, yes she will"
