(Ah)\nAnd good for you, it's like you never even met me\nRemember when you swore to God I was the only\nPerson who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you\nYou will never have to hurt the way you know that I do\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, good for you\nYou look happy and healthy, not me\nIf you ever cared to ask\nGood for you\nYou're doin' great out there without me, baby\nGod, I wish that I could do that\nI've lost my mind, I've spent the night\nCryin' on the floor of my bathroom\nBut you're so unaffected, I really don't get it\nBut I guess good for you\n\n[Break]\n(Ah-ah-ah-ah)\n(Ah-ah-ah-ah)\n[Bridge]\nMaybe I'm too emotional\nBut your apathy's like a wound in salt\nMaybe I'm too emotional\nOr maybe you never cared at all\nMaybe I'm too emotional\nYour apathy is like a wound in salt\nMaybe I'm too emotional\nOr maybe you never cared at all\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, good for you\nYou look happy and healthy, not me\nIf you ever cared to ask\nGood for you\nYou're doin' great out there without me, baby\nLike a damn sociopath\nI've lost my mind, I've spent the night\nCryin' on the floor of my bathroom\nBut you're so unaffected, I really don't get it\nBut I guess good for you\n\n[Outro]\nWell, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily252Embed"
