    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMercy, mercy me\nThings ain't what they used to be, no no\nWhere did all the blue skies go?\nPoison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east\n\n[Verse 2]\nMercy, mercy me\nThings ain't what they used to be, no no\nOil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas\nFish full of mercury\n\n[Verse 3]\nMercy, mercy me\nThings ain't what they used to be, no no\nRadiation under ground and in the sky\nAnimals and birds who live nearby are dying\n\n[Verse 4]\nMercy, mercy me\nThings ain't what they used to be\nWhat about this overcrowded land\nHow much more abuse from man can she stand?"
