I love you)\n\nYesterday we had some rain\nBut, all in all\nI can't complain\nWas it dusty on the train\n(P.S. I love you)\n\nWrite to the Browns\nJust as soon as you're able\nThey came around to call\nI burned a hole\nIn the dining room table\nAnd let me see\nI guess that's all\nNothing else for me to say\nAnd so I'll close\nBut by the way\nEverybody's thinking of you\n(P.S. I love you)\nWrite to the Browns\nJust as soon as you're able\nThey came around to call\nI burned a hole\nIn the dining room table\nAnd let me see\nI guess that's all\nNothing else for me to say\nAnd so I'll close\nBut by the way\nEverybody's thinking of you\n(P.S. I love you)\n(Love you, love you, love you)Embed"
