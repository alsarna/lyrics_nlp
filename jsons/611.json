    "lyrics": "Somewhere beyond the sea\nSomewhere waiting for me\nMy lover stands on golden sands\nAnd watches the ships that go sailing\nSomewhere beyond the sea\nShe's there watching for me\nIf I could fly like birds on high\nThen straight to her arms\nI'd go sailing\nIt's far beyond the stars\nIt's near beyond the moon\nI know beyond a doubt\nMy heart will lead me there soon\n\nWe'll meet beyond the shore\nWe'll kiss just as before\nHappy we'll be beyond the sea\nAnd never again I'll go sailing\n\nI know beyond a doubt\nMy heart will lead me there soon\nWe'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore\nWe'll kiss just as before\nHappy we'll be beyond the sea\nAnd never again I'll go sailing\nNo more sailing\nSo long sailing\nBye, bye sailing..."
