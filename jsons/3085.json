    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShake it up is all that we know\nUsing the bodies up as we go\nI'm waking up to fantasy\nThe shades all around aren't the colors we used to see\nBroken ice still melts in the sun\nAnd times that are broken can often be one again\nWe're soul alone\nAnd soul really matters to me\nTake a look around\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're out of touch\nI'm out of time\nBut I'm out of my head\nWhen you're not around\nYou're out of touch\nI'm out of time\nBut I'm out of my head\nWhen you're not around\n\n[Verse 2]\nReaching out for something to hold\nLooking for a love where the climate is cold\nManic moves and drowsy dreams\nOr living in the middle between the two extremes\nSmoking guns hot to the touch\nWould cool down if we didn't\nUse them so much, yeah\nWe're soul alone\nAnd soul really matters to me\nToo much\n[Chorus]\nYou're out of touch\nI'm out of time\nBut I'm out of my head\nWhen you're not around\nYou're out of touch\nI'm out of time\nBut I'm out of my head\nWhen you're not around\n\n(Out of touch, out of time)\n\nYou're out of touch\nI'm out of time\nBut I'm out of my head\nWhen you're not around\nYou're out of touch (You're soul alone)\nI'm out of time\nBut I'm out of my head\nWhen you're not around"
