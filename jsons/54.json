    "lyrics": "I Apologize LyricsIf I told a lie, if I made you cry\nWhen I said goodbye, I'm sorry\nFrom the bottom of my heart, dear\nI apologize\n\nIf I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame\nMust have been insane, believe me\nFrom the bottom of my heart, dear\nI apologize\n\nI realize I've been unfair to you\nPlease let me make amends\nDon't say that you forgot the love we knew\nAfter all, we were more than friends\n\nGive me back your glance, give me back romance\nGive me one more chance, forgive me\nFrom the bottom of my heart, dear\nI apologize\nIf I made you blue, I've had heartaches too\nNow I beg of you, forgive me\nFrom the bottom of my heart, dear\nI apologizeEmbed"
