(Do, do-do-do)\nMy good thing\nYou've been gone too long (Do, do, do-do-do)\n[Verse 2]\nPeople say I should forget\nThere's plenty more, don't get upset\nPeople say she's doing fine\nMutual friends I see sometime\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat's not what I want to hear\nI want to hear she wants me near\n\n[Chorus]\nGood thing\nWhere have you gone? (Do, do-do-do)\nMy good thing\nYou've been gone too long\n(Do, do, do-do-do)\nGood thing\n\n[Piano Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nThen one day, she came back\nI was so happy that I didn't ask\nMorning came into my room\nCaught me dreaming like a fool\n[Outro]\nGood thing, my good thing\n(Do, do-do-do)\nMy good thing, where have you gone\n(Do, do, do-do-do)\nMy good thing, my good thing\n(Do, do-do-do)\nWhere have you gone\nIt's been so long\n(Do, do, do-do-do)\n\nGood God, girl\nGood God, girl\nGood God, girl\nGood GodEmbed"
