I shouldn't wonder\nWhen I can feel you whet my appetite\nWith all the power you're releasing\nIt isn't safe to walk the city streets alone\nAnticipation is running through me\nLet's find the keys and turn this engine on\n\n[Bridge]\nI can feel you breathe\nI can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me home tonight\nI don't want to let you go 'til you see the light\nTake me home tonight\nListen, honey, just like Ronnie sang\nBe my little baby, oh, ho, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get frightened in all this darkness\nI get nightmares I hate to sleep alone\nI need some company a guardian angel\nTo keep me warm when the cold winds blow\n[Bridge]\nI can feel you breathe\nI can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me home tonight\nI don't want to let you go 'til you see the light\nTake me home tonight\nListen, honey , just like Ronnie sang\nBe my little baby\nBe my little baby, uh-huh\n\nJust like Ronnie sang\nI said\nJust like Ronnie sang\nBe my little baby\nBaby, my darlin', uh, uh, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nI feel a hunger\nIt's a hunger\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me home tonight\nI don't want to let you go 'til you see the light\nTake me home tonight\nListen, honey, just like Ronnie sang\nBe my little baby, oh, ho, oh\n[Chorus]\nTake me home tonight\nI don't want to let you go 'til you see the light\nTake me home tonight\nListen, honey, just like Ronnie sang\nBe my little baby, oh, ho, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me home tonight\nI don't want to let you go 'til you see the light\nTake me home tonight\nListen, honey, just like Ronnie sang\nBe my little baby, oh, ho, oh"
