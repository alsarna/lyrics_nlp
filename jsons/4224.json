(Diggin', diggin', diggin' on you)\nWhen all I can think about is you\nWhat was it in a line, that made me fall for you?\nDo you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?\n\nDiggin' the scene\nIt's on like that\nDiggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you\nAnd I am diggin' the scene\n\n[Chorus]\nDiggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me\nBaby baby-ooo-baby, baby\nIt's on like that, it's on like that\nI gotta be in love or somethin' like that\nDiggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me\nBaby baby-ooo-baby, baby\nIt's on like that, it's on like that\nI gotta be in love or somethin' like that7Embed"
