LyricsHear the night music playing?\nDon't you know what it's saying?\nWe should feel it together\nForever\n\nFeel the beat and just hold on\nTo the sweet midnight flowing\nFeel the music inside you\nI'll be there too\n\nNow's the time our dreams are finally coming true\nFeels so good we're crying\nNow's the time when it's down to me and you\nSpread these wings, we'll be flying\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nDon't you know when it's touching you?\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nTime to show all your feeling\nAll the night is revealing\nLet the rhythm enfold you\nLet me hold you\n\nNow we turn into music\nNow we will never lose it\nWhen the rhythm and night ride\nNo heart can hide\n\nThere are times that never ever come again\nMemories there for the making\nWhen the night calls, we better let it in\nAll this love for the taking\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nDon't you know when it's touching you?\nWon't you help me to let it through?\nDon't you know what the night can do?\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nKnow what the night can do?\nDon't you know what the night can do?\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nKnow what the night can do?\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nThere are times that never ever come again\nMemories there for the making\nWhen the night calls, we better let it in\nAll this love for the taking\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nDon't you know when it's touching you?\nWon't you help me to let it through?\nDon't you know what the night can do?\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nKnow what the night can do?\nDon't you know what the night can do?\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nKnow what the night can do?\nDon't you know what the night can do?\n\nDon't you know what the night can do?\nKnow what the night can do?\nDon't you know what the night can do?Embed"
