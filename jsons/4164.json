    "lyrics": "Looking around the house\nHidden behind the window and the door\nSearching for signs of life\nBut there's nobody home\n\nWell, maybe I'm just too sure\nOr maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it\nPieces of note fall down, but the letter said\n\n[Chorus:]\nAha, it was good\nLiving with you, aha, it was good\nAh-ah-ah-ah-aha it was good\nLiving with you, aha, it was good\nAh-ah-ah, good good good\nSitting around the house\nWatching the sun trace the shadow on the floor\nSearching for signs of life\nBut there's nobody home\nWell, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter\nNow maybe we'll see on the fourth of July\nBut I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud\nWell I'm not sure, and I'm not too proud to say\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nYeah, you were so good\nYeah, you were so good\nYeah, that's right"
