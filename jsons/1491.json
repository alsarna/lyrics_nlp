(whoo-hoo!)\nCrystal Blue Persuasion\n\n[Verse 2]\nBetter get ready\nGonna see the light\nLove, love is the answer (whoo-hoo!)\nAnd that's alright\nSo don't you give up now (whoo-hoo!)\nSo easy to find\nJust look to your soul (look to your soul!)\nAnd open your mind\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, Mm-hmm\nIt's a new vibration\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, Crystal\nBlue Persuasion\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe tomorrow\nWhen he looks down\nIn every green field (whoo-hoo!)\nAnd every town\nAll of his children\nIn every nation\nThere'll be, Peace and Good\nBrotherhood\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, Yeah\n\n[Outro]\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!\nOh!\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!\nCrystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!4Embed"
