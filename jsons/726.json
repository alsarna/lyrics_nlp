    "lyrics": "Yellow bird, yellow bird\nI'd fly away with you but I am not a yellow bird\nYou're more lucky than me\nI also had a pretty girl, she's not with me today\nTake tenderness, then they fly away\nThey're all the same, those pretty girls\nYou can fly away, in the sky away\nYou're more lucky than me\nThat is very sad, makes me feel so bad\nYou can fly away, in the sky away\nThat is very sad, makes me feel so bad\nDid your lady friend leave the nest again?\nSo here I sit, nothing I can do\nDid your lady friend leave the nest again?\nWish that I were a yellow bird"
