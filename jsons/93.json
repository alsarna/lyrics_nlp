    "lyrics": "I'm walking behind you on your wedding day\nAnd I'll hear you promise to love and obey\nThough you may forget me, you're still on my mind\nLook over your shoulder, I'm walking behind\n\nMaybe I'll kiss again with a love that's new\nBut I shall wish again I was kissing you\n\n'Cause I'll always love you wherever you go\nAnd though we are parted, I want you to know\nThat if things go wrong, dear, and fate is unkind\nLook over your shoulder, I'm walking behind\n\nIf things go wrong, dear, and fate is unkind\nLook over your shoulder, I'm walking behind"
