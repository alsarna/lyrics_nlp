    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHere in my car\nI feel safest of all\nI can lock all my doors\nIt's the only way to live\nIn cars\nHere in my car\nI can only receive\nI can listen to you\nIt keeps me stable for days\nIn cars\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere in my car\nWhere the image breaks down\nWill you visit me please\nIf I open my door\nIn cars?\nHere in my car\nI know I've started to think\nAbout leaving tonight\nAlthough nothing seems right\nIn cars\n\n[Instrumental]"
