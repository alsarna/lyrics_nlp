    "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nPlease help me I'm falling in love with you\nClose the door to temptation don't let me walk through\nTurn away from me darling I'm begging you to\nPlease help me I'm falling in love with you\n\n[Verse]\nI belong to another whose arms have grown cold\nBut I promised forever to have and to hold\nI can never be free dear but when I'm with you\nI know that I'm losing the will to be true\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease help me I'm falling and that would be sin\nClose the door to temptation don't let me walk in\nFor I mustn't want you but darling I do\nPlease help me I'm falling in love with you"
