Ah Ah Ahhhh!\n\nI'll always love you\nFor the rest of my days\nYou have won my heart and my soul\nWith your sweet, sexy ways\nYou gave me hope\nWhen I needed someone near\nYou bring me happiness\nEvery day of every year!\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll always love you\nFor all that you are\nYou have made my life complete\nYou're my lucky star\nYou are the one\nThat I'd been searching for\nYou are my everything\nTell me who could ask for more\nAnd I'll always love you\nHoney, this will never end\nI need you by my side, baby\nYou're my lover my friend\nOh, my friend\n\n[Jazz solo]\n\nYou gave my world\nA thrill I've never known\nAnd filled my eager heart\nWith a love to call my own\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll always love you\nYou must know how much I do\nYou can count on me forever\nAnd I will take good care\nOf you\n\n[Outro]\nI'll always love you\nI'm so happy that your mine\nI always love you\nTill the end of time1Embed"
