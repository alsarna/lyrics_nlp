    "lyrics": "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes LyricsThey asked me how I knew\nMy true love was true\nI of course replied, something here inside\nCannot be denied\nThey said some day you'll find\nAll who love are blind\nWhen your heart's on fire, you must realize\nSmoke gets in your eyes\nSo I chaffed them and I gaily laughed\nTo think they could doubt my love\nYet today my love has flown away\nI am without my love\n(Without my love)\nNow laughing friends deride\nTears I cannot hide, hide\nSo I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies\n\nSmoke gets in your eyes\n(Smoke gets in your eyes)\n(Smoke gets in your eyes)\nSmoke gets in your eyes!4Embed"
