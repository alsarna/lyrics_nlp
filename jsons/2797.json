    "lyrics": "She's so very nice\nYou should break the ice\nLet her know that she's on your mind\nWhat you trying to hide\nWhen you know inside\nShe's the best thing you'll ever find\nAh, can't you see it\nDon't you think she's feeling the same\nAh, I guarantee it\nShe's the one that's calling your name\n\nChorus:\nYou should hear how she talks about you\nYou should hear what she said\nShe says she would be lost without you\nShe's half out of her head\nYou should hear how she talks about you\nShe just can't get enough\nShe says she would be lost without you\nShe is really in love\n\nI ain't telling tales\nAnybody else could repeat the things that I've heard\nShe's been talking sweet and it's on the street\nHow our girlfriend's spreading the word\nAh, you should hurry\nYou should let her know how you feel\nAh, now don't you worry\nIf you know the story's for real\nRepeat first half of the Chorus\n\nYou should hear how she talks about you\nShe is really in love\n\nAh, you should hurry\nYou should let her know how you feel\nAh, now don't you worry\nIf you're scared the love is for real\n\nRepeat Chorus and then fade"
