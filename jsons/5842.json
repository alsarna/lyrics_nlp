I came back for her\nJust to give it to ya, like you asked for it\nMan, that thing in them jeans too fat for her\nRebounds so I caught her off the backboard\nI told her: “Baby girl, come here\nKnow I run the town even when I ain't from there.”\nAnd I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party\nI made what yo' nigga make in one year\nThat's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice\nMoney can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced\nDon’t overthink, just hope it's right\nI’m only here for the night\n[Chorus]\nAyy, we've got a good thing\nDon’t know if I’ma see you again\nBut is that a good thing?\n'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am\nI know what's on your brain\nYou probably hoped it never would end\nLike, “Is it the real thing\nOr is it just a one-night stand?”\nWell then\n\n[Bridge]\nLet me see you get high, then go low\nNow, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?\nI’m here for one night, how far will you go?\nI wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)\nHigh, then go low\nNow, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?\nI’m here for one night, how far will you go?\nI wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nCarolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene\nHottest nigga on the block\nDamn, girl, you're mean\nThey be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world\nOn my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”\nShe bad and she know it\nSome niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic\nCould you be my escort?\n'Cause just like them two door Fords\nDamn, they don’t make 'em like you no more\nCole World, real Cole World\nThem boys cool—me, I’m on fire\nKnow what's on my mind\nTryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight\nMove slow, 'cause you wanna live fast\nUp late so you'll probably skip class\nLife is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right\n[Chorus]\nAyy, we've got a good thing\nDon’t know if I’ma see you again\nBut is that a good thing?\n'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am\nI know what's on your brain\nYou probably hoped it never would end\nLike, “Is it the real thing\nOr is it just a one-night stand?”\nWell then (Cole World)\n\n[Outro]\nStraight up, now tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)\nOr is it just a hit-and-run?\n(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya\nI just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)\nCome here, girl, let's get it on!\n(Work out for me)\nStraight up, now tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)\nOr is it just a hit-and-run?\nWell straight up, I tell ya\nI just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)\nCome here, girl, let's get it on!\n(Work out for me)"
