Ah\nOh, oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling\nCome on!\nWhoo!\nAlright\n\nEverybody starts to lose control when the music is right\nIf you see somebody hanging around, don't get uptight\nThe only thing we wanna do tonight\nIs go round and round and turn upside down\nCome on, let's get down!\n(Cheering)\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!\nHey, hey, hey.......(Cheering)\n\nSo come on and get loose\nDon't hold back 'cause it ain't no use\nHard to keep your feet on the ground\n'Cause when we like to party, we only wanna get down\n\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling.  Ah\nOh, what a feeling, baby, when we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling.  Whoa!\n\nSay what?\nCan't stop now, just getting started\nEverybody clap your hands.  (Clapping)\nCome on!\nEverybody let's dance!\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling"
