    "lyrics": "Cross Over the Bridge LyricsIf you're a guy that's had a gal in each and every port\nAnd you've forgot the rules of love that life has always taught\nAnd if you broke as many hearts as ripples in a stream\nWell, brother, here's the only way that you can be redeemed\n\nCross over the bridge, cross over the bridge\nChange your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge\nLeave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you\nBrother, cross over the bridge\n\nIf you have built a boat to take you to the greener side\nAnd if that boat is built of ev'ry lie you ever lied\nYou'll never reach the Promised Land of love, I guarantee\n'cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea\n\nCross over the bridge, cross over the bridge\nChange your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge\nLeave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you\nBrother, cross over the bridge\nI know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call\nBut think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall\n'cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love\nAnd she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above\n\nCross over the bridge, cross over the bridge\nChange your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge\nLeave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you\nBrother, cross over the bridge\n\nCross over the bridge\n\nCross over the bridge\n\nCross over the bridgeEmbed"
