    "lyrics": "My Foolish Heart LyricsThe night is like a lovely tune\nBeware my foolish heart\nHow white the ever constant moon\nTake care my foolish heart\n\nThere's a line between love and fascination\nThat's hard to see, how many names such as this\nFor they both have the very same sensation\nWhen you're locked in the magic of a kiss\n\nHer lips are much too close to mine\nBeware my foolish heart\nBut should our eager lips combine\nThen let the fire start\n\nFor this time it isn't fascination\nOr a dream that will fade and fall apart\nIt's love, this time it's love\nMy foolish heartEmbed"
