    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHere I lay all alone\nTossin', turning\nLonging for some of your tender love\nI'm waiting for the right moment to come\nSo I can thank you for\nAll the tender love you've given to me\n\n[Chorus]\nTender love, love so tender\nPulling me close to you\nBaby, I surrender\n\n[Verse 2]\nCandles they light the dark\nNow I see how lovely the feelings are\nAll the tender love you've given to me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI want you more and more, can't resist you\nOoh then I feel your touch, tender love\nLoving me straight from the heart, hold me nearer\nPlease let me be a part of the tender love you're giving to me\n\n[Chorus]\nTender love, love so tender\nHolding me close to you\nBaby, I surrender\nOoh yeah, surrender baby\n\n[Non-lyrical Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nTender love\nPlease let me be a part\nTender love"
