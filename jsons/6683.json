Iann Dior LyricsWhy you always such a noob\nWalking round, acting brand new\nI don't wanna see you yelling oof\nBut you ain't got a clue\nAfk and lagging out too\nRunning 'round in yellow green and blue\nWhy you always such a noob\nWalking round, acting brand new\nI don't wanna see you yelling oof\nBut you ain't got a clue\nAfk and lagging out too\nRunning 'round in yellow green and blue\nNow i'm on the golden gun\nGoing for that arsenal dub\nSomehow never got my builder's club\nNewbie, i'm not an oder\nWon't you ever understand\nI only simp for builderman\nBoy it's obvious that you're such a noob\nLaggy internet that you barely move\nAnd you love dying in murder mystery 2\nNow i'm tired of you acting so confused\nWe play games we love and have fun with our free time\nWe've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime\nWhy you always such a noob\nWalking round, acting brand new\nI don't wanna see you yelling oof\nBut you ain't got a clue\nAfk and lagging out too\nRunning 'round in yellow green and blue\nWhy you always such a noob\nWalking round, acting brand new\nI don't wanna see you yelling oof\nBut you ain't got a clue\nAfk and lagging out too\nRunning 'round in yellow green and blue\nSo why's it saying you're online but you don't show up\nWe could stick to playing the blox as we grow up\nIf i could then i would give you all my robux\nBut i'm sorry i can only give you bobux\nI'm talking anthro\nArsenal, winning every bloxy\nFinding every key to escape from the piggy\nGot a tycoon, now i'm spitting out money\nGot a simulator full of bees making honey\nWe play games we love and have fun with our free time\nWe've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime\nWhy you always such a noob\nWalking round, acting brand new\nI don't wanna see you yelling oof\nBut you ain't got a clue\nAfk and lagging out too\nRunning 'round in yellow green and blue\nWhy you always such a noob\nWalking round, acting brand new\nI don't wanna see you yelling oof\nBut you ain't got a clue\nAfk and lagging out too\nRunning 'round in yellow green and blue\nOofEmbed"
