    "lyrics": "How can people be so heartless?\nHow can people be so cruel?\nEasy to be hard\nEasy to be cold\n\nHow can people have no feelings?\nHow can they ignore their friends?\nEasy to be proud\nEasy to say No\n\nEspecially people who care about strangers\nWho care about evil and social injustice\nDo you only care about the \"being crowd\"?\nHow about a needed friend? I need a friend\n\nHow can people be so heartless?\nYou know I'm hung up on you\nEasy to be proud\nEasy to say No\n\nEspecially people who care about strangers\nWho care about evil and social injustice\nDo you only care about the \"being crowd\"?\nHow about a needed friend? We all need a friend\n\nHow can people be so heartless?\nHow can people be so cruel?\nEasy to be proud\nEasy to say no\nEasy to be cold\nEasy to say no\n\nCome on, easy to give in\nEasy to say No\nEasy to be cold\nEasy to say No\n\nOh, it's too easy to say No"
