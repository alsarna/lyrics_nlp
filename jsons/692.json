    "lyrics": "Running Scared LyricsJust runnin' scared each place we go\nSo afraid that he might show\nYeah, runnin' scared, what would I do?\nIf he came back and wanted you\nJust runnin' scared, feelin' low\nRunnin' scared, you love him so\nJust runnin' scared, afraid to lose\nIf he came back which one would you choose\nThen all at once he was standing there\nSo sure of himself, his head in the air\nMy heart was breaking, which one would it be\nYou turned around and walked away with me1Embed"
