Look what love gave us\nA world full of killing and blood spilling\nThat world never came\n\n[Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott]\nAnd they say that a hero could save us\nI'm not gonna stand here and wait\nI'll hold on to the wings of the eagles\nWatch as we all fly away\n(Ahh-ahh)\n\n[Bridge: Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott]\nNow that the world isn't ending\nIt's love that I'm sending to you\nIt isn't the love of a hero\nAnd that's why I fear it won't do\n[Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott]\nAnd they say that a hero could save us\nI'm not gonna stand here and wait\nI'll hold on to the wings of the eagles\nWatch as we all fly away\n\n[Outro: Chad Kroeger & (Josey Scott)]\nAnd they're watching us (Watching us)\nThey're watching us (Watching us)\nAs we all fly away\nAnd they're watching us (Watching us)\nThey're watching us (Watching us)\nAs we all fly away\nAnd they're watching us (Watching us)\nThey're watching us (Watching us)\nAs we all fly away\nWhoa"
