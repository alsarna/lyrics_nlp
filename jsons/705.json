    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe took a hundred pounds of clay\nAnd then He said, \"Hey, listen\"\n\"I'm gonna fix this-a world today\"\n\"Because I know what's missin' \"\nThen He rolled His big sleeves up\nAnd a brand new world began\nHe created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man\nWhoa-oh-oh, yes he did\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith just a hundred pounds of clay\nHe made my life worth livin'\nAnd I will thank Him every day\nFor every kiss you're givin'\nAnd I'll thank Him every night\nFor the arms that are holdin' me tight\nAnd He did it all with\nJust a hundred pounds of clay\nYes he did, whoa-oh, yes He did\n\n[Bridge]\nNow can'tcha just see Him a-walkin' 'round and 'round\nPickin' the clay uppa off the ground?\nDoin' just what He should do\nTo make a livin' dream like you\n[Verse 3]\nHe rolled His big sleeves up\nAnd a brand new world began\nHe created a woman and a lots of lovin' for a man\nWhoa-oh-oh, yes he did\nWith just a hundred pounds of clay\n\n[Outro]\nPeople, let me tall ya what He did\nWith just a hundred pounds of clay"
