    "lyrics": "They try to tell us we're too young\nToo young to really be in love\nThey say that love's a word\nA word we've only heard\nBut can't begin to know the meaning of\n\nAnd yet we're not too young to know\nThis love will last though years may go\nAnd then someday they may recall\nWe were not too young at all\n\nAnd yet we're not too young to know\nThis love will last though years may go\nAnd then someday they may recall\nWe were not too young at all"
