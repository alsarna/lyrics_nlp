    "lyrics": "Troglodyte LyricsNote: While there is a pounding beat in the background, the\nSong is spoken rather than sung\nWhat we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time\nWhen the only people that existed were troglodytes...cave men...\nCave women...Neanderthal...troglodytes. Let's take the average\nCave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up\nTry to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:\n\"Dance...dance\". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look\nIn the mirror: \"Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a\nWoman gotta find a woman\". He'd go down to the lake where all the\nWoman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look\nHe'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause\nIt might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd\nBe swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there\nWet and frightened. He said: \"Move...move\". She got up. She was a\nBig woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one\nOf the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:\n\"Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me\nSock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!\". She looked down on him\nShe was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said\n(falsetto):\n\"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". He said: \"Wha?\". She said (falsetto):\n\"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". You know what he said? He started it way\nBack then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto)\n\"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\" he said \"Right on! Right on! Hotpants!\nHotpants! Ugh...ugh...ugh\"Embed"
