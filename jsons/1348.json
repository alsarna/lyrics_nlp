    "lyrics": "(spoken): \"A preachment, dear friends, you are about to receive\nOn John Barleycorn, nicotine, and the temptations of Eve\"\n(Bronx cheer)\n\nNo parkin' by the sewer sign\nHot dog, my razor's broke\nWater drippin' up the spout\nBut I don't care, let it all hang out\n\nHangin' from a pine tree by my knees\nSun is shinin' through the shade\nNobody knows what it's all about\nIt's too much, man, let it all hang out\n\nSaw a man walkin' upside down\nMy T.V.'s on the blink\nMade Galileo look like a Boy Scout\nSorry 'bout that, let it all hang out\n\nSleep all day, drive all night\nBrain my numb, can't stop now\nFor sure ain't no doubt\nKeep an open mind, let it all hang out\n\nIt's rainin' inside a big brown moon\nHow does that mess you baby up, leg\nEatin' a Reuben sandwich with sauerkraut\nDon't stop now, baby, let it all hang out\nLet it all hang out (harmonized) [repeat to fade]"
