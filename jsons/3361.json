No!\nBut I know my way, oh yeah, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used follow\nYeah, that's true\nBut my following days are over\nNow, I just gotta follow through\nAnd I remember what my father said\nHe said \"Son, life is simple\"\nIt's either cherry red or\n[Chorus]\nMidnight blue, oh, oh\nMidnight blue, oh, oh\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou were the restless one\nAnd you did not care that\nI was the trouble boy\nLookin' for a double dare\nI won't apologize for the things\nI've done and said\nBut when I win your heart\nI'm gonna paint it cherry red\nI don't want to talk about it\nWhat you do to me?\nI can't live without it\nAnd you might think that\nIt's much too soon\nFor us to go this far\n\n[Chorus]\nInto the midnight blue, oh, oh\nIt's midnight blue, oh, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nThe things could be different\nBut that'd be a shame\n'Coz I'm the one who could feel the sun\nRight in the pouring rain\nI won't say where\nAnd I don't know when\nBut soon there's gonna come a day, baby\nI'll be back again\nYeah, I'll be back for you\nYou see I'm saving up my love\n[Outro]\nInto the midnight blue, oh, oh\nMidnight blue, oh, oh\nMidnight blue, oh, oh\nThe deepest midnight blue, oh, oh\nInto the midnight blue, oh, oh\nAnother midnight blue tonight [?], oh, oh\nInto the midnight blue, oh, oh\nOh, midnight blue, oh, oh\nMidnight blue, oh, oh, midnight blue\nMidnight blue, oh, oh\nMidnight blueEmbed"
