    "lyrics": "My Cup Runneth Over LyricsSometimes in the morning\nWhen shadows are deep\nI lie here beside you\nJust watching you sleep\n\nAnd sometimes I whisper\nWhat I'm thinking of\nMy cup runneth over\nWith love\n\nSometimes in the evening\nWhen you do not see\nI study the small things\nYou do constantly\n\nI memorize moments\nThat I'm fondest of\nMy cup runneth over\nWith love\nIn only a moment\nWe both will be old\nWe won't even notice\nThe world turning cold\n\nAnd so, in these moments\nWith sunlight above\nMy cup runneth over\nWith love\n\nMy cup runneth over\nWith love\nWith loveEmbed"
