    "lyrics": "I'm a simulator\nBaby I'm state of the art\nI'll become your money\nHoney I'll break your heart\nI will burrow in\nPatience vigilance and discipline\nI'm an incubator baby\nI'm where you begin\n\nSo break out your stationary\nHoist your petard\nWear out you library card\nDig up your whole back yard\nYou will think you have me\nEvery shadow every spark\nBut like a pure illuminator babe\nYou'll never know me from the dark\n\nI am a teenager\nIt's my time to rage\nBusting out of your cage dear\nBaby where's the stage\nYou will endorse me\nYou will attend to me\nI’ll be the dictator and you will be bent to me\nSo break out your stationary\nHoist your petard\nWear out you library card\nDig up your whole back yard\nYou will think you’ve found me\nEvery pebble every stone\nBut I’m a proper excavator babe\nYou'll never know me from the bone"
