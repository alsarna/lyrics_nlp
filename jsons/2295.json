    "lyrics": "What you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\n\nSo you're having trouble with your romance\nWell, you better check it out before it goes, yeah\n'Cause you might not be seeing things just the way you should\nAnd you don't recognize what everybody knows\n\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\n\nAnd all at once, you're ready to hang it up\n(You're ready to hang it up)\n'Cause things didn't turn out the way you planned, no\nAnd all your friends, they calling you a fool\n'Cause you don't know a good thing\nWhen you got it in your hand\n\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\nAnd all at once, you're ready to hang it up\n(You're ready to hang it up)\n'Cause things didn't turn out the way you planned, no\nAnd all your friends, they calling you a fool\n(You're just a fool)\n'Cause you don't know a good thing\nWhen you've got it in your hand\n\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\n\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?\nWhat you gonna do when she says goodbye?\nWhat you gonna do when she is gone?"
