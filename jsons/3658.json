    "lyrics": "The game of love is to live it up and, baby, not too high\nDon't you know, if you wanna get down with Mister P\nYou gotta go and let your backbone slide\nWhat a feeling when you push it up, push it down\nYou gotta push it up, push it down, feel good\n\nGeorge Michael or Marvin Gaye\nIt still is the same in you\nBaby, don't tease, ooh, just please\n'Cause you know it's just me and you\n\nAll or nothing (hush)\nIt's got to be\nSomething gotta show when you're livin' under heat\nAll or nothing (hush)\nGirl, let it be\nTake it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat\n\nI'm under heat, oh, baby, please take it slow\nGive me some time and maybe our love will grow\nI want a suitor, baby, and make it right\nTake it from me, babe, I wanna rock all night\n\nIf it's good for me, it's good for you\nYou gotta never let your mood get dry\nJust keep it wet and my 740 jet\nIs pushing right on high\nGeorge Michael or Marvin Gaye\nIt still is the same in you\nBaby, don't tease, ooh, just please\n'Cause you know it's just me and you\n\nAll or nothing (hush)\nIt's got to be\nSomething gotta show when you're livin' under heat\nAll or nothing (hush)\nGirl, let it be\nTake it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat\n\nI'm under heat, oh, baby, please take it slow\nGive me some time and maybe our love will grow\nI want a suitor, baby, and make it right\nTake it from me, babe, I wanna rock all night\n\nPush it up, push it down\nPush it where it feels real good\nOn my lips, my sweet bumble bee\nSting me like I knew you could\n\nAll or nothing (hush)\nIt's got to be\nSomething gotta show when you're lyin' under me\nAll or nothing (hush)\nGirl, let it be\nTake it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat"
