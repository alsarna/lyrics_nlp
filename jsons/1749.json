I've been robbed!!\nStick-up, highway robbery\nStole my love from me--it's a case of grand larceny\nStick-up, highway robbery\nIt's a felony--heartbreak in the first degree\n\nHe walked into my life hungry for love\nSo sweet and cautiously he chased my love\nA devil in disguise, he fooled my heart\nTricked me into the dark, \"HOLD UP!!\"--I was shocked\nPulled his charms, took me in his arms\nStole my love, and now he's gone\n\nStick-up, highway robbery\nStole my love from me--it's a case of grand larceny\nStick-up, highway robbery\nIt's a felony--heartbreak in the first degree\n\nA thief in the night, he stole my mind\nBreaking lover's hearts should be a crime\nBut he'll return to the scene of the crime\nI'll set a tender trap, he'll be unaware\nI'll wear a smile down the aisle\n'Cause he's the father of my child\n\nStick-up, highway robbery\nStole my love from me--it's a case of grand larceny\nStick-up, highway robbery\nIt's a felony--heartbreak in the first degree\n(Boom-boom, shakalaka, boom-boom-boom-boom) (4X)\nHelp!! I've been robbed!!\nStick-up, highway robbery\nStole my love from me--it's a case of grand larceny\nStick-up, highway robbery\nIt's a felony--heartbreak in the first degree"
