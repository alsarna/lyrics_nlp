    "lyrics": "Every time I see you lookin' my way\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\nIn the car or walking down the highway\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\n\nWhen you move up closer to me\nI get a feelin' that's ooo-wee (ah)\nCan't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat\n'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love\n\nWhen I feel you put your arms around me\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\nThen I'm glad, I'm mighty glad I found you\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\n\nWhen you asked me to meet your ma\nI knew that, baby, we'd be going far (ah)\nCan't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?\n'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love\n\nAll my friends are cryin' out to meet you\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\nNow's the time to go and see the preacher\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\n\nWedding bells are gonna chime\nBaby baby, you're gonna be mine (ah)\nCan't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat\n'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?\nBaby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?"
