    "lyrics": "There's a light\nA certain kind of light\nThat never shown on me\nI want my life to be\nLived with you\nLived with you\n\nThere's a way\nEverybody says\nTo do each and every little thing\nBut what does it bring\nIf I ain't got you\nIf I ain't got you\n\nBaby you don't know what its like\nBaby you don't know what its like\nTo love somebody\nTo love somebody\nThe way I love you\n\nIn my mind\nI see your face again\nI know my frame of mind\nYou ain't got to be so blind\nBut I'm blind\nSo very blind\nI'm a man\nCan't you see what I am\nI live and breathe and for you\nBut what good does it do\nIf I ain't got you\nIf I ain't got you\n\nBaby you don't know what its like\nBaby you don't know what its like\nTo love somebody\nTo love somebody\nThe way I love you"
