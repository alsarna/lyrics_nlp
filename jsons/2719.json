    "lyrics": "I was all right for a while\nI could smile for a while\nBut when I saw you last night\nYou held my hand so tight\nWhen you stopped to say 'hello'\nAnd though you wished to me well\nYou couldn't tell\n\nThat I'd been\nCrying, over you\nCrying, over you\n\nThen you said so long\nLeft me standing all alone\nAlone and crying\nCrying\nCrying\nCrying\n\nIt's hard to understand\nThat the touch of your hand\nCan start me crying\n\nI thought that I, was over you\nBut it's true, so true\nI love you even more, than I did before\nBut, darling, what can I do\nWhile you don't love me\nAnd I'll always be\nCrying, over you\nCrying, over you\n\nYes, now you're gone\nAnd from this moment on\nI'll be crying\n(Crying)\nCrying\n(Crying)\nCrying\n(Crying)\nCrying\nCrying\nCrying\nOver you"
