I don't believe it (Boy, bye)\nBut really, I was doin' just fine without ya\nLookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)\nBaby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)\nLike I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)\nHow you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)\nYou runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)\n\n[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]\nYeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)\nNow you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)\nSmelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)\nSlidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)\nI know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)\nBest you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)\nAnd if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)\nYou're toxic\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nBeautiful mistakes\nI make inside my head\nShe's naked in my bed\nAnd now we lie awake\nMakin' beautiful mistakes\nI wouldn't take 'em back\nI'm in love with the past\nAnd now we lie awake\nMakin' beautiful mistakes\n\n[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nNah-nah-nah, in my head\nNah-nah-nah, in my bed\nNah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (Oh)\nMakin' beautiful mistakes\nNah-nah-nah, in my head\nNah-nah-nah, in my bed\nNah-nah-nah, eh\nMakin' beautiful mistakes\n\n[Outro: Adam Levine]\nNah-nah-nah\nNah-nah-nah (Ooh)\nNah-nah-nah25Embed"
