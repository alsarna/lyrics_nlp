Is the head dead yet?\nYou know, the boys in the newsroom got a running bet\nGet the widow on the set!\nWe need dirty laundry\n\n[Verse 5]\nYou don't really need to find out what's goin' on\nYou don't really wanna know just how far it's gone\nJust leave well enough alone\nEat your dirty laundry\n\n[Chorus]\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're stiff\nKick 'em all around\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Kick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're stiff\nKick 'em all around)\n[Verse 6]\nDirty little secrets, dirty little lies\nWe got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie\nWe love to cut you down to size\nWe love dirty laundry\n\n[Verse 7]\nWe can do \"The Innuendo\", we can dance and sing\nWhen it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing\nWe all know that crap is king\nGive us dirty laundry!\n\n[Outro]\n(Kick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nWhen they're up, when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up\nKick 'em when they're down)"
