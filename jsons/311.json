    "lyrics": "You can gamble for match sticks, you can gamble for gold\nThe stakes may be heavy or small\nBut if you haven't gambled for love and lost\nYou haven't gambled at all\n\nSo they call me a moonlight gambler\nWell, I've gambled for love and lost\nWhen I gamble for love but it isn't in the cards\nOh, what heartaches it can cost me\n\nWin or lose, I'm a moonlight gambler\nAnd a winner is what I long to be\nSo I'll gamble for love just as long as I live\nTill the day Lady Luck smiles down on me\n\nWell, you can gamble for match sticks\nYou can gamble for gold\nStakes may be heavy or small\nBut if you haven't gambled for love and lost\nWell, then you haven't gambled at all\n\nNo, if you haven't gambled for love in the moonlight\nThen you haven't gambled at all\n\nSo I'll gamble for love just as long as I live\nTill the day Lady Luck smiles down on me\nSo they call me the moonlight gambler\nYes, they call me the moonlight gambler"
