    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOne early morning as I was walking\nI met a woman, we started talking\nI took her home to get a few nips\nBut all I had was a mint julep\nI don't remember just how I started\nI only know that we should have parted\nI stole a kiss and then another\nI didn't mean to take it further\nOne mint julep was the cause of it all\n\n[Bridge]\nThe lights were burning low, there in the parlor\nWhen through the kitchen door up popped her father\nHe said, \"I saw you when you kissed my daughter\nBetter wed her right now, or face a slaughter\"\nI didn't know just what I was doing, I had to marry or face ruin\n\n[Chorus]\nA mint julep, a mint julep [x2]\nOne mint julep was the cause of it all\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, I don't want to bore you with my troubles\nBut from now on I'll be thinking double\nI'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey\nI got six extra children from a-getting frisky\n[Chorus]"
