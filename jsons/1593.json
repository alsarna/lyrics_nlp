    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nA thumb goes up, a car goes by\nIt's nearly 1 AM and here am I\nHitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride\nGotta get me home by the mornin' light\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've got no fare to ride a train\nI'm nearly drownin' in the pourin' rain\nHitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride\nGotta get me home to my baby's side\n\n[Chorus]\nRide, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride\nRide, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride\n\n[Verse 3]\nLong-distance call I got today\nShe sounded lonely, so I'm on my way\nHitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride\nGotta get me home, keep her satisfied\n\n[Chorus]\nRide, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride\nRide, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride\n[Verse 4]\nA thumb goes up, a car goes by\nWon't somebody stop and help a guy\nHitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride\nBeen away too long from my baby's side\n\n[Chorus]\nRide, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride\nRide, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride\n\n[Outro]\nRide, ride\nRide, ride"
