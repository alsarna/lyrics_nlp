I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times\nNo more camouflage, I wanna be exposed\nAnd not be afraid to fall\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have\nAnd cannon ball into the water\nI'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have\nFor you I will\nAlways want what you can't have\nBut I've got to try\nI'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have\nFor you I will\nFor you I will\nFor you I will\nFor you\n[Bridge]\nIf I could dim the lights in the mall and create a moon\nYeah, I would\nAnd shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah\nThat's what I'd do\nThat's what I'd do\nTo get through to you, yeah\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have\nAnd cannon ball into the water\nI'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have\nFor you I will\nYou always want what you can't have\nBut I've got to try\nI'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have\nFor you I will\nFor you I will\nFor you I will\nFor you I will"
