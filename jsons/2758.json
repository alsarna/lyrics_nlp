    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMet my old lover in the grocery store\nThe snow was falling Christmas Eve\nI stole behind her in the frozen foods\nAnd I touched her on the sleeve\nShe didn't recognize the face at first\nBut then her eyes flew open wide\nShe went to hug me and she spilled her purse\nAnd we laughed until we cried\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe took her groceries to the checkout stand\nThe food was totaled up and bagged\nWe stood there lost in our embarrassment\nAs the conversation dragged\nWent to have ourselves a drink or two\nBut couldn't find an open bar\nWe bought a six-pack at the liquor store\nAnd we drank it in her car\n\n[Chorus]\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to now\nAnd tried to reach beyond the emptiness\nBut neither one knew how\n[Verse 3]\nShe said she'd married her an architect\nWho kept her warm and safe and dry\nShe would have liked to say she loved the man\nBut she didn't like to lie\nI said the years had been a friend to her\nAnd that her eyes were still as blue\nBut in those eyes, I wasn't sure if I\nSaw doubt or gratitude\nShe said she saw me in the record stores\nAnd that I must be doing well\nI said the audience was heavenly\nBut the traveling was hell\n\n[Chorus]\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to now\nAnd tried to reach beyond the emptiness\nBut neither one knew how\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to time\nReliving in our eloquence\nAnother 'auld lang syne'\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe beer was empty and our tongues were tired\nAnd running out of things to say\nShe gave a kiss to me as I got out\nAnd I watched her drive away\nJust for a moment I was back at school\nAnd felt that old familiar pain\nAnd as I turned to make my way back home\nThe snow turned into rain\n[Saxophone Solo]"
