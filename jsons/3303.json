These days it can be a question of life or death. It's as simple as that. And this song is not about casual sex\n\n[Part 1]\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere's things that you guess\nAnd a'things a'that you know\nThere's boys you can trust\nAnd a'girls that you don't\nThere's little things you hide\nAnd little things that you show\nSometimes you think you're gonna get it\nBut you don't and that's just the way it goes\n\n[Pre - Chorus]\nI swear I won't tease you\nWon't tell you no lies (Yeah)\nDon't need no Bible\nJust look in my eyes\nI've a'waited so long baby\nNow that we're friends\nEvery man's got his patience\nAnd here's where mine ends\n[Chorus]\nI want your sex\nI want your love\nI want your sex\nI want your...sex\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's playin' on my mind\nIt's dancin' on my soul\nIt's taken so much time\nSo why don't you just let me go\nI'd really like to try\nOh, I'd really love to know\nWhen you tell me you're gonna regret it\nThen I tell you that I love you but you still say no\n\n[Pre - Chorus]\nI swear I won't tease you\nWon't tell you no lies (Yeah)\nDon't need no Bible\nJust look in my eyes (Oooh)\nI've waited so long baby\nOut in the cold\nI can't take much more girl\nI'm losing control\n[Chorus]\nI want your sex\nI want your love\nI want your sex\nI want your…sex (sex! ow!)\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's natural, it's chemical (let's do it)\nIt's logical habitual (can we do it?)\nIt's sensual but most of all\nSex is something that we should do\nSex is something for me and you\nSex is natural, sex is good\nNot everybody does it\nBut everybody should\nSex is natural, sex is fun\nSex is best when it's one on one\nOne on one\n\n[Break]\nHoo ah (sex) I'm not your father\nHoo ah (sex) I'm not your brother\nHoo ah (sex) talk to your sister\nHoo ah (sex) I am a lover\nHoo ah (sex) Wooooo-ooooohh!!\nHoo ah (sex)\nHoo ah (sex) Ow!\nC-c-c-c-c-c-come on (Hoo ah)\n[Outro]\nWhat's your definition of dirty baby?\nWhat do you consider pornography?\nDon't you know I love it till it hurts me baby?\nDon't you think it's time you had sex with me?\n\nWhat's your definition of dirty baby?\nWhat do you call pornography?\nDon't you know I love it till it hurts me baby?\nDon't you think it's time you had sex with me?\nOw! Sex with me\nOw! Sex with me\nMmmm have sex with me (Hoo ah)\nC-c-c-c-c-c-come on\n\n*************************\n[Part 2]\n\nOh so much love, that you've never seen\nLet's make love, put your trust in me (hmm)\nDon't you listen to what they told you\nBecause I love you, let me hold you\n\nOh, I'm not your brother\nI'm not your father\nOh will you ever change your mind?\nI'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold\nBut baby you've been so unkind...oh\n\nCome on\nI want your sex\nCome on, I want your sex\nThat's right, all night\nOh, I want your sex\nI want your…sex\n\nSexy baby's (Sexy baby's)\nSexy body (Sexy body)\nKeeps me guessing (Keeps me guessing)\nWith a promise (Oh)\nI know we can come together\nBut the question is Will we ever ever?\n\nSexy baby's (Sexy baby's)\nSexy body (Sexy body)\nKeeps me guessing (Keeps me guessing)\nWith a promise (Oh)\nI know we can come together\nBut the question is Will we ever ever?\n\nOhhh together\nYou and me\n\nI want your love2Embed"
