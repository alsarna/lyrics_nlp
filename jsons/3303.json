    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt’s late\nTime for bed\nSo I sit and I wait\nFor that gin and tonic\nTo go to your head\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know\nIt’s a devious plan\nBut it’s the only way that I know\nTo get those big bad car keys\nOut of your hand\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know\nThat I remain a gentleman\nBut even so\nThere’s only so much\nA gentleman can stand\nSleep with me\nOh\nSleep with me, tonight\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy cards are on your table\nMy dreams are in your bed\nOh, if I was able\nI’d be there instead\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nOh, sleep with me tonight"
