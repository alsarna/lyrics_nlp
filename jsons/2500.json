    "lyrics": "You don't bring me flowers\nYou don't sing me love songs\n\nYou hardly talk to me anymore\nWhen I come through the door at the end of the day...\n\nI remember when you couldn't wait to love me\nUsed to hate to leave me\nNow after loving me late at night\n\nWhen it's good for you, babe\nAnd you're feeling all right\n\nWhen you just roll over and turn out the light...\nAnd you don't bring me flowers anymore\n\nIt used to be so natural\n\nIt used to be...\n\nTo talk about forever\n\nMmm...\n\nBut used-to-bes don't count anymore\nThey just lay on the floor\nTill we sweep them away\nAnd baby I remember all the things you taught me\n\nI learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry\n\nWell, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie\n\nSo you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye\n\nSo you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye\nYou don't bring me flowers any more...\n\nWell, you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye...\n\n'Cause you don't say you need me;\n\nYou don't sing me love songs\n\nYou don't bring me flowers anymore..."
