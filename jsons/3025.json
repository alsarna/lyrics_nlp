Your heart's still wild\n\nShooting at the walls of heartache\nBang bang\nI am the warrior\nWell, I am the warrior\nAnd heart to heart you'll win if you survive\nThe warrior.  The warrior\n\nYou talk, talk, talk to me\nYour eyes touch me physically\nStay with me, we'll take the night\nAs passion takes another bite\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nWho's the hunter, who's the game\nI feel the beat call your name\nI hold you close in victory\nI don't want to tame your animal style\nYou won't be caged in the call of the wild\nShooting at the walls of heartache\nBang bang\nI am the warrior\nWell, I am the warrior\nAnd heart to heart to win if you survive\nThe warrior.  The warrior\nI am the warrior\n\nShooting at the walls of heartache\n(Shooting at the walls of heartache.) The warrior\nI am the warrior and heart to heart you'll win\nHeart to heart you'll win if you survive\nThe warrior.  The warrior\n\nShooting at the walls of heartache\nBang bang\nI am the warrior\nYes, I am the warrior and victory is mine\n(Shooting at the walls of heartache.) The warrior\nI am the warrior\nShooting at the walls of heartache"
