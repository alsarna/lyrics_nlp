(Holla!)\nNah, nah, nah\nNot in the back of my car-ar-ar\nIf you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah\n\n[Verse 2: Kesha]\nBoy, c'mon and get my rocks off\nCome put a little love in my glove box\nWanna dance, with no pants on?\nMeet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox\nSo cut to the chase, kid\n'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is\nI wanna be naked and you're wasted\n[Pre-Chorus: Kesha]\nMusic's up\nListen hot stuff, I'm in love with this song\nSo just hush\nBaby, shut up\nHeard enough\n\n[Chorus: Kesha]\nStop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah\nThink you'll be getting this?\nNah, nah, nah\nNot in the back of my car-ar-ar\nIf you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah\n\n[Bridge: 3OH!3]\nYou be delaying, you always saying some â€‹shit\nYou say I'm playin', I'm never layin' the dick\nSaying, \"Blah, blah, blah.\"\n'Cause I don't care who you are in this bar\nIt only matters who I is\n\n[Chorus: Kesha]\nStop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah\nThink you'll be getting this?\nNah, nah, nah\nNot in the back of my car-ar-ar\nIf you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah\nBlah, blah, blah\nThink you'll be getting this?\nNah, nah, nah\nNot in the back of my car-ar-ar\nIf you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah\n[Outro: Kesha]\nOh\nBlah blah blah\nStop talking\nStop ta-ta-talking that"
