    "lyrics": "And now the purple dusk of twilight time\nSteals across the meadows of my heart\nHigh up in the sky the little stars climb\nAlways reminding me that we're apart\n\nYou wander down the lane and far away\nLeaving me a song that will not die\nLove is now the stardust of yesterday\nThe music of the years gone by\n\nSometimes I wonder why I spend\nThe lonely night dreaming of a song\nThe melody haunts my reverie\nAnd I am once again with you\nWhen our love was new\nAnd each kiss an inspiration\nBut that was long ago\nNow my consolation\nIs in the stardust of a song\n\nBeside a garden wall\nWhen stars are bright\nYou are in my arms\nThe nightingale tells his fairy tale\nA paradise where roses bloom\nThough I dream in vain\nIn my heart it will remain\nMy stardust melody\nThe memory of love's refrain"
