    "lyrics": "I was born and raised down in Alabama\nOn a farm way back up in the woods\nI was so ragged the folks used to call me \"Patches\"\nPapa used to tease me about it\n'Course deep down inside he was hurt\n'Cause he'd done all he could\n\nMy papa was a great old man\nI can see him with a shovel in his hand\nSee, education he never had\nHe did wonders when the time got bad\n\nThe little money from the crops he raised\nBarely paid the bills we made\n\nOh, life had kicked him down to the ground\nWhen he tried to get up life would kick him back down\nOne day papa called me to his dyin' bed\nPut his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said\nHe said:\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nTo pull the family through\nMy son, it's all left up to you\"\n\nTwo days later papa passed away\nAnd I became a man that day\nSo I told mama I was gonna quit school\nBut she said that was daddy's strictest rule\nSo every morning fore I went to school\nI fed the chickens and I chopped wood too\nSometimes I felt that I couldn't go on\nI wanted to leave, just run away from home\n\nBut I would remember what my daddy said\nWith tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed\nHe said:\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nI've tried to do my best\nIt's up to you to do the rest\"\n\nThen one day a strong rain came\nAnd washed all the crops away\nAnd at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying\nThe weight of the whole world on my shoulders\nAnd you know, mama knew what I was going through\n\n'Cause every day I had to work the fields\n'Cause that's the only way we got our meals\nSee, I was the oldest of the family\nAnd everybody else depended on me\n\nEvery night I heard my mama pray:\n\"Lord, give him strength to make another day\"\nThough years have passed and all the kids have grown\nThe angels took mama to a brand new home\nLord knows, people, I shedded tears\nBut my daddy's voice helped me through the years\nSayin':\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nTo pull the family through\nMy son, it's all left up to you\"\n\nOh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you son\nI've tried to do my best\nIt's up to you to do the rest\"\n\nI could still hear papa when he's saying:\n\n\"Patches, I'm depending on you, son\nTo pull the family through\nMy son, it's all left up to you\""
