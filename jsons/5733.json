Can you get to my flow?\nCan we promise we won't let go?\nAll the things that I need, all the things that you need\nYou can make it feel so real\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Vika Jigulina & Edward Maya]\n'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind\nWhen I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control\n'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind\nWhen I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go\n\n[Hook 1: Edward Maya]\nI hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie\nI hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside\n\n[Chorus 1: Edward Maya]\nI can fix all those lies\nOh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you\nYou won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside\nMy heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you\n[Verse: Vika Jigulina]\nCan I get to your soul? Can you get to my flow?\nCan we promise we won't let go?\nAll the things that I need, all the things that you need\nYou can make it feel so real\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Vika Jigulina & Edward Maya]\n'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind\nWhen I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control\n'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind\nWhen I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go\n\n[Bridge: Vika Jigulina]\nWhen you gonna stop breaking my heart?\nDon't let go, don't let go to my love\n\n[Hook 2: Edward Maya]\nI hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie\nI hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside\nI hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside\nI haven't seen you smilin' but I'm dying tonight\n\n[Chorus 2: Edward Maya]\nI can fix all those lies\nOh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you\nYou won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside\nMy heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you\nOh baby I'll try to make the things right\nI need you more than air when I'm not with you\nPlease don't ask me why, just kiss me this time\nMy only dream is about you and I"
