What we chasin'?\nWhy the bottom? Why the basement?\nWhy we got good shit, don't embrace it?\nWhy the feel for the need to replace me?\nYou're the wrong way track from the good\nI want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at\nLike a heart in the best way should\nYou can give it away, you had it and you took the pay\nBut I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors\nKeep hopin' for, now the door is yours\nKeep also home\n'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'\n\n[Chorus]\nMmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, darlin'\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm fighting hard to hold my own\nJust can't make it all alone\nI'm holding on, I can't fall back\nI'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black\n[Chorus]\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nPut your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, darlin'\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, darlin'\n\n[Outro]\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out, baby\nI'm beggin', beggin' you\nSo put your loving hand out42Embed"
