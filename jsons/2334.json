    "lyrics": "Night Moves - Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band Tribute LyricsI was a little too tall\nCould've used a few pounds\nTight pants points hardly reknown\nShe was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes\nAnd points all her own sitting way up high\nWay up firm and high\n\nOut past the cornfields where the woods got heavy\nOut in the back seat of my '60 Chevy\nWorkin' on mysteries without any clues\nWorkin' on our night moves\nTryin' to make some front page drive-in news\nWorkin' on our night moves\nIn the summertime\nIn the sweet summertime\nWe weren't in love, oh no, far from it\nWe weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit\nWe were just young and restless and bored\nLivin' by the sword\nAnd we'd steal away every chance we could\nTo the backroom, to the alley or the trusty woods\nI used her, she used me\nBut neither one cared\nWe were gettin' our share\nWorkin' on our night moves\nTryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues\nWorkin' on our night moves\nAnd it was summertime\n\nAnd oh the wonder\nWe felt the lightning\nAnd we waited on the thunder\nWaited on the thunder\n\nI awoke last night to the sound of thunder\nHow far off I sat and wondered\nStarted humming a song from 1962\nAin't it funny how the night moves\nWhen you just don't seem to have as much to lose\nStrange how the night moves\nWith autumn closing inEmbed"
