    "lyrics": "I just can't help believing\nWhen she smiles up soft and gentle\nWith a trace of misty morning\nAnd a promise of tomorrow in her eyes...\n\nAnd I just can't help believing\nWhen she's lying close beside me\nAnd my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh...\n\nThis time the girl is gonna stay\nThis time the girl is gonna stay...\nFor more than just a day\n\nI just can't help believing\nWhen she slips her hand in my hand\nAnd it feels so small and helpless\nThat my fingers fold around it like a glove...\n\nAnd I just can't help believing\nWhen she's whispering her magic\nAnd her tears are shining honey sweet with love...\n\nThis time the girl is gonna stay (This time the girl is gonna stay)\nThis time the girl is gonna stay...\nFor more than just a day\nFor more than just a day...\n(I just can't help believing...)"
