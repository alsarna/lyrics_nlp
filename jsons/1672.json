Don't you worry\nA new day is dawning\nWe'll catch the sun, and away we'll fly\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you ready to sit by his throne?\nAre you ready not to be alone?\nSomeone's coming to take you home\nAnd if you're ready, then he'll carry you home\nAre you ready?\nAre you ready?\n[Verse 1]\nPeople say that he won't come\nAnd I don't know what say you\nBut if he should, would you be the one?\nI've got a little question I'd like to ask you\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you ready to sit by his throne?\nAre you ready not to be alone?\nSomeone's coming to take you home\nAnd if you're ready, then he'll carry you home\nAre you ready?\nAre you ready?\n\n[Verse 2]\nBrothers and sisters, I have many (brothers and sisters)\nStumbling along to do their thing (do their thing)\nLove is a song, it's better than any\nIt's better for music, it's easy to sing (easy to sing)\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you ready to sit by his throne?\nAre you ready not to be alone?\nSomeone's coming to take you home\nAnd if you're ready, then he'll carry you home\n[Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you ready to sit by his throne?\nAre you ready not to be alone?\nSomeone's coming to take you home\nAnd if you're ready, then he'll carry you home\n\n[Outro]\n(Yes, I'm ready)\nAre you ready? (Yes, I'm ready)\nAre you ready? (Yes, I'm ready)\nI've got to know, yeah (Yes, I'm ready)\nYou sound real good (Yes, I'm ready)\nAre you ready? (Yes, I'm ready)\nGonna be sunshine again (Yes, I'm ready)\nAnd the flowers growing (Yes, I'm ready)\nChildren playing (Yes, I'm ready)\nGonna be all right (Yes, I'm ready)\nYou've got to be ready (Yes, I'm ready)\nI know you're ready (Yes, I'm ready)\nSay it loud one more time (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nOh, yeah (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nOh, yeah (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nSay that out loud (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nSing it out loud (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nSounds so good to me! (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\n(Yes, yes, I'm ready)\n(Yes, yes, I'm ready)\n(Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nAlright (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nGonna be alright (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nGonna be alright (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nAlright (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nCome on, y'all (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nMake me feel so good (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nMake me feel so good (Yes, yes, I'm ready)\n(Yes, yes, I'm ready)\nNo more dyin' (Yes, yes, I'm ready)Embed"
