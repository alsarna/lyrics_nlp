    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, take me back down where cool water flow, ya\nLet me remember things I love, ah\nStoppin' at the log where catfish bite\nWalkin' along the river road at night\nBarefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can hear the bullfrog callin' me, oh\nWonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree\nLove to kick my feet way down the shallow water\nShoo fly, dragon fly, get back to your mother\nPick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River\nWell\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n1:10 - 1:32\n\n[Verse 3]\nUp at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord\nWith flat car riders and cross-tie walkers\nOld Cody Junior took me over\nSaid \"You're gonna find the world is smolderin'\nAnd if you get lost, come on home to Green River\"\nWell\nCome on home"
