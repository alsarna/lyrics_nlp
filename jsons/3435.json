    "lyrics": "Lover, I'm off the streets\nI'm gonna go where the bright lights\nAnd the big city meet\nWith a red guitar, on fire\nDesire\n\nShe's the candle burnin' in my room\nYeah, I'm like the needle\nThe needle and spoon\nOver the counter, with a shotgun\nPretty soon, everybody's got one\nI'm in a fever, when I'm beside her\nDesire\nDesire\nAnd the fever, gettin' higher\nDesire\nDesire\n(Burning, burning)\n\nShe's the dollars\nShe's my protection\nYeah, she's the promise\nIn the year of election\nSister I can't let you go\nLike a preacher stealin' hearts at a travellin' show\nFor love or money, money, money... ?\nAnd the fever, gettin' higher\nDesire"
