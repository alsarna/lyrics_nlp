Chorus]\nI can see for miles and miles\nAnd miles and miles and miles\nOh yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you think that I don't know about\nThe little tricks you've played\nAnd never see you when deliberately\nYou put things in my way\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nWell, here's a poke at you\nYou're gonna choke on it too\nYou're gonna lose that smile\nBecause all the while\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see for miles and miles\nI can see for miles and miles\nI can see for miles and miles\nAnd miles and miles and miles\nOh yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou took advantage of my trust in you\nWhen I was so far away\nI saw you holding lots of other guys\nAnd now you've got the nerve to say\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nThat you still want me\nWell, that's as may be\nBut you gotta stand trial\nBecause all the while\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see for miles and miles\nI can see for miles and miles\nI can see for miles and miles\nAnd miles and miles and miles\nOh yeah\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Verse 4]\nI know you've deceived me\nNow here's a surprise\nI know that you have\n'Cause there's magic in my eyes\n\n[Alt.
