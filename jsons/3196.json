    "lyrics": "You turn me on, you lift me up\nAnd like the sweetest cup I'd share with you\nYou lift me up, don't you ever stop, I'm here with you\nNow it's all or nothing\nCause you say you'll follow through\nYou follow me, and I, I, I follow you\n\nWhat you gonna do when things go wrong?\nWhat you gonna do when it all cracks up?\nWhat you gonna do when the Love burns down?\nWhat you gonna do when the flames go up?\nWho is gonna come and turn the tide?\nWhat's it gonna take to make a dream survive?\nWho's got the touch to calm the storm inside?\nWho's gonna save you?\nAlive and Kicking\nStay until your love is, Alive and Kicking\nStay until your love is, until your love is, Alive\n\nOh you lift me up to the crucial top, so I can see\nOh you lead me on, till the feelings come\nAnd the lights that shine on\nBut if that don't mean nothing\nLike if someday it should fall through\nYou'll take me home where the magic's from\nAnd I'll be with you\nWhat you gonna do when things go wrong?\nWhat you gonna do when it all cracks up?\nWhat you gonna do when the Love burns down?\nWhat you gonna do when the flames go up?\nWho is gonna come and turn the tide?\nWhat's it gonna take to make a dream survive?\nWho's got the touch to calm the storm inside?\nDon't say goodbye\nDon't say goodbye\nIn the final seconds who's gonna save you?\n\nOh, Alive and Kicking\nStay until your love is, love is, Alive and Kicking\nOh, Alive and Kicking\nStay until your love is, love is, Alive and Kicking"
