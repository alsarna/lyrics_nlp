    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm booking myself a one-way flight\nI gotta see the color in your eyes\nAnd telling myself I'm gonna be alright\nWithout you, baby, is a waste of time\nYeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed\nIt got washed away in a summer rain\nYou can't undo a fall like this\n'Cause love don't know what distance is\nYeah, I know it's crazy\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I don't want \"good\" and I don't want \"good enough\"\nI want \"can't sleep, can't breathe without your love\"\nFront porch and one more kiss\nIt doesn't make sense to anybody else\nWho cares if you're all I think about?\nI've searched the world and I know now\nIt ain't right if you ain't lost your mind\nYeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy\nAre you with me, baby? Let's be crazy\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why\nWanna feel good, don't have to be right\nThe world makes all kinds of rules for love\nI say you gotta let it do what it does\nI don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight\nCatching up calls and a date sometimes\nI love that we're rebels and we still believe\nWe're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah\nUh, and I know we're crazy, yeah\n[Chorus]\nBut I don't want \"good\" and I don't want \"good enough\"\nI want \"can't sleep, can't breathe without your love\"\nFront porch and one more kiss\nIt doesn't make sense to anybody else\nWho cares if you're all I think about?\nI've searched the world and I know now\nIt ain't right if you ain't lost your mind\nYeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy\nAre you with me, baby? Let's be crazy\n\n[Interlude]\nNa-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, I don't want \"good\" and I don't want \"good enough\"\nI want \"can't sleep, can't breathe without your love\"\nFront porch and one more kiss\nIt doesn't make sense to anybody else\nWho cares if you're all I think about?\nI've searched the world and I know now\nIt ain't right if you ain't lost your mind\nYeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, look at us, baby\nTonight the midnight rules are breaking\nThere's no such thing as wild enough\nMaybe we just think too much\nWho needs to play it safe in love?\nLet's be crazy\n[Outro]\nWho cares if we're crazy\nWe gotta be crazy\nI know that we're crazy\nSo let's be crazy\nYeah, yeah"
