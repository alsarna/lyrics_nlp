    "lyrics": "Burning Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]\nTwo worlds collide, rival nations\nIt's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations\nBravely we hope against all hope\nThere is so much at stake\nSeems our freedom's up against the ropes\nDoes the crowd understand?\nIs it East versus West or man against man?\nCan any nation stand alone?\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the burning heart just about to burst\nThere's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst\nIn the darkest night rising like a spire\nIn the burning heart the unmistakable fire\nIn the burning heart\n[Verse 2]\nIn the warriors code there's no surrender\nThough his body says stop his spirit cries - never!\nDeep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you\nIt's the paradox that drives us on\nIt's a battle of wills\nIn the heat of attack it's the passion that kills\nThe victory is yours alone\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the burning heart just about to burst\nThere's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst\nIn the darkest night rising like a spire\nIn the burning heart the unmistakable fire\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the burning heart just about to burst\nThere's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst\nIn the darkest night rising like a spire\nIn the burning heart the unmistakable fire\nIn the burning heart just about to burst\nThere's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst\nIn the darkest night rising like a spire\nIn the burning heart the unmistakable fire\n[Outro]\nIn the burning heart8Embed"
