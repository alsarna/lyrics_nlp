    "lyrics": "I love you for so many reasons\nWhich means I love you for all seasons\nFirst of all, I love you with the freshness of a spring day\nThen I love you with hot passions like the summer sun\nWhen june's here to stay\nI don't know how to explain my love's seasonal change\nIt seems never the same - all I know is\nI love you for so many reasons\nWhich means I love you for all seasons\nI love you with the gentleness of a falling leaf on an autumn day\nBut most of all, I love you with the briskness of a winter\nWhen the snows come out to stay\nI don't know how to explain my love's seasonal change\nIt seems never the same - all I know is\nI love you for so many reasons\nWhich means i love you for all seasons\n(autumn, summer, winter, springtime)\nI love you for so many reasons\nWhich means i love you for all seasons\n(repeat to fade)"
