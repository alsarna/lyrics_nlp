    "lyrics": "Nothin' but a good fuckin' day, rock it\nNow listen\n\nNot a dime, I can't pay my rent\nI can barely make it through the week\nSaturday night I wanna do my girl\nRight now I can't make ends meet\n\nI'm always workin', slavin' everyday\nGotta get a break from same ol', same ol'\nI need a chance just to get away\nYou can hear me think, this is what I'd say\n\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better\nOh I feel get better and\n\nSpend my money on women and wine\nI couldn't tell you where I spent last night\nReally sorry about the shape I'm in\nJust like my fun, every now and then\n\nI'm always workin', slavin' every day\nGotta get a break from same ol', same ol'\nI need a chance just to get away\nYou can hear me think, this is what I'd say\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better\nAll you do to me, oh look it down\n\nYou see I raise a toast to all of us\nYou're busting your ass every day\nIf wantin' the good life is such a crime\nLord, then put me away, here's to ya\n\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better, sing it\n\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better"
