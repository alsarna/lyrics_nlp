Hahaha, yeah\nNow listen...\n\n[Verse 1]\nNot a dime, I can't pay my rent\nI can barely make it through the week\nSaturday night, I'd like to make my girl\nBut right now, I can't make ends meet, no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm always workin', slavin' every day\nGotta get a break from that same old, same old\nI need a chance just to get away\nIf you could hear me think this is what I'd say\n[Chorus]\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better than this\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey say I spend my money on women and wine\nBut I couldn't tell you where I spent last night\nI'm really sorry about the shape I'm in\nI just like my fun every now-and-then\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm always workin', slavin' every day\nGotta get a break from that same old same old\nI need a chance just to get away\nIf you could hear me think this is what I'd say\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better than this\n\n[Bridge]\nYou see I, I raise a toast to all of us\nWho are breakin' our backs every day\nIf wanting the good life is such a crime\nLord, then, put me away, yeah\nHere's to ya\n[Guitar solo]\n\nMmm, guitar!\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better than this\nDon't need nothin' but a good time\nHow can I resist?\nAin't lookin' for nothin' but a good time\nAnd it don't get better than this\n\n[Outro]\nIt don’t get better, babeEmbed"
