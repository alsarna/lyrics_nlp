    "lyrics": "When I was a little bitty boy\nMy grandmother bought me a cute little toy\nSilver bells hangin' on a string\nShe told me it was my ding a ling\n\n[Chorus]\nMy ding a ling, my ding a ling\nI want to play with my ding a ling\nMy ding a ling, my ding a ling\nI want to play with my ding a ling\n\nAnd then mother took me to Grammar School\nBut I stopped all in the vestibule\nEvery time that bell would ring\nCatched me playin' with my ding a ling\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOnce I was climbing the garden wall\nI slipped and had a terrible fall\nI fell so hard I heard bells ring\nBut held on to my ding a ling\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOnce I was swimming cross Turtle creek\nMany snappers all around my feet\nSure was hard swimming cross that thing\nWith both hands holdin' my ding a ling\n[Chorus]\n\nThis here song it ain't so sad\nThe cutest little song you ever had\nThose of you who will not sing\nYou must be playin' with your own ding a ling\nMy ding a ling Your ding a ling, your ding a ling\nWe saw you playin' with your ding a ling\nMy ding a ling everybody sing\nI want to play with my ding a ling"
