    "lyrics": "{Intro}\nWalking through forests of palm tree apartments\nScoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents\nDown by the waterhole, drunk every Friday\nEating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday\nLions and tigers who wait in the shadows\nThey're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows\nWell, let's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yeah\nWell, I'm a tiger when I want love\nBut I'm a snake if we disagree\n\nJust say a word and the boys will be right there\nWith claws at your back to send a chill through the night air\nIs it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?\nThunder and lightning couldn't be bolder\nI'll write on your tombstone, and thank you for dinner\nThis game that we animals play is a winner\n\nWell, let's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yes\nI'm a tiger when I want love\nI'm a snake if we disagree, yes\n{Bridge}\nThe rivers are full of crocodile nasties\nAnd he who made kittens put snakes in the grass\nHe's a lover of life but a player of pawns\nYes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn\nTo light up His Jungle as play is resumed\nThe monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune\nWell, let's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yes\nI'm a tiger when I want love\nAnd I'm a snake when we disagree, yes\n\nLet's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yes\nWell, I'm a tiger when I want love\nAnd I'm a snake when we disagree"
