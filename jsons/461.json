    "lyrics": "Does she love me? It's too soon to know\nCan I believe her when she tells me so?\nIs she foolin'? Is it all a game?\nAm I the fire or just another flame?\nA one-sided love would break my heart\nShe may be just acting and playing a part\n\nIf she don't love me let her tell me so\nI won't hold her if she wants to go\nThough I'll cry when she's gone\nI won't die, I'll live on\nIf it's so, it's too soon, way too soon to know\n\nIf she don't love me let her tell me so\nI can't hold her if she wants to go\nThough I'll cry when she's gone\nI won't die, I'll live on\nIf it's so, it's too soon, way too soon to know"
