    "lyrics": "The End LyricsAt the end of a rainbow, you'll find a pot of gold\nAt the end of a story, you'll find it's all been told\nBut our love has a treasure our hearts can always spend\nAnd it has a story without any end\n\nAt the end of a river, the water stops its flow\nAt the end of a highway, there's no place you can go\nBut just tell me you love and you are only mine\nAnd our love will go on 'til the end of time\n\nAt the end of a river, the water stops its flow\nAt the end of a highway, there's no place you can go\nBut just tell me you love and you are only mine\nAnd our love will go on 'til the e-end of time\n\n'Til the end of timeEmbed"
