Join my happy song!\"\nI wave my hat to all I meet\nAnd they wave back to me\nAnd blackbirds call so loud and sweet\nFrom ev'ry green wood tree\n\nHigh overhead, the skylarks wing\nThey never rest at home\nBut just like me, they love to sing\nAs o'er the world we roam\n\nOh, may I go a-wandering\nUntil the day I die!\nOh, may I always laugh and sing\nBeneath God's clear blue sky!Embed"
