    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGalveston, oh Galveston\nI still hear your sea winds blowin'\nI still see her dark eyes glowin'\nShe was twenty-one\nWhen I left Galveston\n\n[Verse 2]\nGalveston, oh Galveston\nI still hear your sea waves crashing\nWhile I watch the cannons flashing\nI clean my gun\nAnd dream of Galveston\n\n[Bridge]\nI still see her standing by the water\nStanding there lookin' out to sea\nAnd is she waiting there for me?\nOn the beach where we used to run\n\n[Verse 3]\nGalveston, oh Galveston\nI am so afraid of dying\nBefore I dry the tears she's crying\nBefore I watch\nYour sea birds flying in the sun\n[Outro]\nAt Galveston\nAt Galveston"
