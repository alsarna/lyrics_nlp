No, I just can't take the pain\nWould you ever trust me? No, I'll never feel the same\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge: Lita Ford]\nI know I been so hard on you\nI know I told you lies\nIf I could have just one more wish\nI'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes\n\n[Chorus: Lita Ford]\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain unchanged?\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain the same? Oh, yeah\n\n[Outro: Ozzy Osbourne]\nClose your eyes, close your eyes\nYou gotta close your eyes for me1Embed"
