(Yeah)\nNot everything in this magical world is quite what it seems\nFollow me, follow me\nDown, down, down, down\n(Turn off the light, turn off the light)\nFollow me down, follow me\nDown, down, down\n(Turn off the light, turn off the light)\nAnd I said follow me, follow me, follow me\nDown, down, down, down\n(Do you see all my dreams?)\nSee all my dreams\nFollow me follow me follow me\nDown down down down\nSee all my dreams\nSee all my dreams\n\n[Outro]\nAll in me yeah, where is your logic?\n(Turn off the light, turn off the light)\nWho do you need?\n(Turn off the light, turn off the light)\nWhere can you turn?\n(Turn off the light, turn off the light)\nWho do you need?5Embed"
