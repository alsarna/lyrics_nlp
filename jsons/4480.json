(After love, after love, after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough, no\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough, no\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough, no\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough, no\nDo you believe in life after love?32Embed"
