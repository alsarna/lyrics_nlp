(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)\nWell, I kiss the ground she walks on\n(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)\nShe's a real good friend right to the end\n(So together like a hand in glove.)\nA lonely man when she's gone\n(People, ain't no woman like the one I love.)\nOooh. What a good, good thing I've got\nShe means to me a lot\n\n(Ain't no woman like the I've got.)\nNo, no, they don't come better\n(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)\nShe don't ask for things, no diamond rings\n(So together, like a hand in glove.)\nLike pages in a letter\n(Ain't no woman like the one I love, people.)\n\n(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)\nWell, I kiss the ground she walks on\n(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)\nI'm a lonely man when my baby's gone"
