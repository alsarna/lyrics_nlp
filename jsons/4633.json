Isn't it wonderful now?\"\n\n[Verse 1: Art]\nI close my eyes when I get too sad\nI think thoughts that I know are bad\nClose my eyes and I count to ten\nHope it's over when I open them\n\nI want the things that I had before\nLike a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door\nI wish I could count to ten\nMake everything be wonderful again\n\n[Verse 2: Art]\nHope my mom and I hope my dad\nWill figure out why they get so mad\nHear them scream, I hear them fight\nThey say bad words that make me wanna cry\nClose my eyes when I go to bed\nAnd I dream of angels who make me smile\nI feel better when I hear them say\nEverything will be wonderful someday\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Art]\nPromises mean everything when you're little\nAnd the world's so big\nI just don't understand how\nYou can smile with all those tears in your eyes\nTell me everything is wonderful now\n\n[Chorus: Band and Art]\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nPlease don't tell me everything is wonderful now\n\n[Verse 3: Art]\nI go to school and I run and play\nI tell the kids that it's all okay\nI laugh aloud so my friends won't know\nWhen the bell rings I just don't wanna go home\n\nGo to my room and I close my eyes\nI make believe that I have a new life\nI don't believe you when you say\nEverything will be wonderful someday\n[Pre-Chorus: Art]\nPromises mean everything when you're little\nAnd the world is so big (so big)\nI just don't understand how\nYou can smile with all those tears in your eyes\nWhen you tell me everything is wonderful now\n\n[Chorus: Band and Art]\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNo\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNo, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNo\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNo, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now\n\n[Bridge: Art]\nI don't wanna hear you say\nThat I will understand someday\nNo, no, no, no\nI don't wanna hear you say\nYou both have grown in a different way\nNo, no, no, no\nI don't wanna meet your friends\nAnd I don't wanna start over again\nI just want my life to be the same\nJust like it used to be\nSome days I hate everything (everything)\nI hate everything (everything)\nEveryone and everything (everything)\nPlease don't tell me everything is wonderful now...\n[Chorus: Band, Children, and Art]\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNo!\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nPlease don't tell me everything is wonderful now\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nNo!
